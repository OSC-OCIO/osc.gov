​Special Counsel Henry J. Kerner today released the following statement on the passing of Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-MD).

“The untimely passing of Chairman Elijah Cummings is a tragic loss not just for his constituents, but for all Americans who value strong, principled leadership on Capitol Hill. I had the honor of working closely with Chairman Cummings and his staff during my time working for both Chairmen Darrell Issa and Jason Chaffetz on the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.  Chairman Cummings will be remembered for his tough but fair approach to oversight that earned him the respect of Members and staff on both sides of the aisle.  

“No one would disagree that Chairman Cummings was a man of strong convictions and principles. He was a fierce advocate for whistleblowers and staunchly supported OSC's work protecting whistleblowers from retaliation. Last year, OSC staff had the pleasure of hearing from Chairman Cummings at our staff all-hands conference. Chairman Cummings delivered a rousing speech dedicated to public service and always being true to oneself, earning a lengthy standing ovation from OSC employees for his passionate words.  

“The whistleblower community has lost one of its great champions. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and staff in this difficult time."
