​​The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) announces that Hampton Dellinger of North Carolina was confirmed by the Senate yesterday as Special Counsel to head OSC.

Mr. Dellinger graduated from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and Yale Law School. After being confirmed by the Senate in October 2021, Mr. Dellinger served in the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) as an Assistant Attorney General overseeing the Office of Legal Policy.

In both government and private practice, Mr. Dellinger has represented whistleblowers and other clients challenging government activities, and is an experienced litigator and legal advocate.  Mr. Dellinger is also a former Deputy Attorney General in the North Carolina Department of Justice and served as Chief Legal Counsel in the Office of the North Carolina Governor.  His work there included investigations into Medicaid fraud and political corruption.

“We are very excited to welcome Hampton as the new Special Counsel,” said OSC’s Acting Special Counsel Karen Gorman. “All of us at OSC look forward to working closely with him to advance OSC’s important mission of safeguarding the merit system, protecting whistleblowers, and promoting accountability in government.”
