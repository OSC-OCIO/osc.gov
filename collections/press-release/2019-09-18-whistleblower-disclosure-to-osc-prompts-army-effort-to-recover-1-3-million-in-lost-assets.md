​The U.S Office of Special Counsel (OSC) today sent [letters](../../~assets/documents/OSC-File-No.-DI-17-3283---Letter-to-the-President_Redacted.pdf) to the President and Congress alerting them that the Army lost possession of six government-purchased fuel trucks worth $1.34 million, largely due to improper contracting procedures. A whistleblower within the U.S. Army Material Command alerted OSC to the issue, which was referred to the Army for investigation. The Army [investigation](../../~assets/documents/OSC-File-No.-DI-17-3283---Agency-Report_Redacted2.pdf) confirmed that a contracting officer's inaction contributed to the agency's inability to quickly uncover and correct the error. The Army is now taking steps to reacquire the government-owned trucks from a private company.

“Whistleblowers play such a critical role in ensuring taxpayer money is not misused," said **Special Counsel Henry J. Kerner**. “In this case, because a whistleblower spoke up, the Army is now taking steps to recover assets worth more than a million dollars. OSC is proud to work with whistleblowers to ensure taxpayer money is not wasted or mismanaged."
