The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) today announced discipline, including a 90-day unpaid suspension and a 130-day unpaid suspension, for two federal employees who violated the Hatch Act.

**Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation**  
An employee at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) violated the Hatch Act by soliciting political contributions for two different partisan political candidates and engaging in political activity while on duty.

OSC's investigation found that the employee hosted a fundraising event at his home for a candidate for partisan political office and personally solicited donations from other individuals for a different candidate. In addition, OSC's investigation found that while on duty, the employee sent emails for the purpose of organizing a campaign event he hosted for a third candidate for partisan political office.   

The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from knowingly soliciting, accepting, or receiving political contributions from any person, even when off duty and away from the federal workplace. By hosting a fundraiser for a candidate and asking others to donate to a candidate's campaign, the employee violated the Hatch Act's solicitation prohibition on multiple occasions. The Hatch Act also prohibits employees from engaging in political activity while on duty, and the FDIC employee violated this prohibition by sending campaign emails while working. In the settlement agreement, the employee agreed to a 130-day suspension without pay for his multiple Hatch Act violations.

**U.S. Coast Guard**  
An OSC investigation determined that a U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) civilian employee violated the Hatch Act by engaging in political activity while on duty and/or in the federal workplace, soliciting political contributions, and using her official authority to affect the results of an election.

Between 2019 and 2021, while on duty or while located at USCG headquarters, the employee shared approximately 18 posts on her personal Facebook account that supported or opposed candidates in the 2020 presidential election, candidates for congressional office, or political parties. In addition, OSC found evidence showing that the employee shared 11 posts on her personal Facebook account that she knew included requests for donations to political candidates or political groups.  Prior to most of the violations, OSC had directly advised the employee about the law's applicability to her social media use. The employee agreed to a 90-day unpaid suspension for her violations.

“Federal employees must understand and fulfill their obligations under the Hatch Act, which include a prohibition on political activity while on-duty, and a 24-7 prohibition on soliciting donations for partisan political campaigns," said Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger.
