​This week marks Special Counsel Henry J. Kerner’s last week at OSC. ​“It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as Special Counsel over the last six years," said Special Counsel Kerner. “I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our staff for their hard work and dedication to OSC's mission. Together, we have achieved record high results for our complainants, while overcoming significant external challenges. I cannot think of any job I would have rather had than leading this dedicated group of civil servants.  I wish Acting Special Counsel Karen Gorman all the best as she takes the helm starting Monday October 23, 2023.​"
