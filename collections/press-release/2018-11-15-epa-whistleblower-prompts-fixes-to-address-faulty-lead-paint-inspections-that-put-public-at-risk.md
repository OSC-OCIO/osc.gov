**Elizabeth Wilde**: “Childhood Lead Poisoning is, tragically, a far too common occurrence in this Country, despite being a completely preventable condition. The irreversible condition of lead poisoning can short circuit the child's normal emotional and intellectual development and instead lead to learning disabilities, emotional instability, and even incarceration: robbing children of productive lives and society of productive citizens.  

  

“Federal law mandates the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development work closely with the Centers for Disease Control and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reduce and eliminate Childhood Lead Poisoning. EPA is charged with enforcing the Lead-based Paint Rule to reduce children's exposure to lead-based paint, the main route of exposure. This is dependent on properly trained and credentialed inspectors conducting valid, evidentially documented, inspections to determine compliance and to pursue enforcement when warranted.

“Unfortunately, inspectors who were not trained or credentialed were doing inadequate inspections (in some cases no inspections) putting children at risk. When EPA Management failed to respond to my public health concerns, I contacted PEER who informed me that we could refer the case to the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), which PEER helped me to do.

  

“OSC listened to my story, looked at the documents, and asked the questions necessary to refer my whistleblower claim for investigation. As a direct result, EPA substantiated my claim, remedied the deficiencies, and is now committed to better protect mothers and their children from lead-based paint poisoning.”
