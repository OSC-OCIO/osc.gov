​The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) today filed a Hatch Act complaint with the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) charging a federal employee with violating the Hatch Act's prohibitions against engaging in political activity while on duty or in the federal workplace and knowingly soliciting political contributions.  

In its complaint, OSC alleges that the individual, an elected party chairman representing a major political party in Hawaii, used social media to solicit contributions for political candidates and used federal agency computers to compose, review, and edit party-related materials, such as a “social media strategy" directed toward the success or failure of partisan political candidates. In addition, the individual sent dozens of emails soliciting political contributions, composed and published several online articles soliciting party contributions, and used agency computers to update a party Facebook account during the workday.

The Hatch Act generally prohibits federal employees from knowingly soliciting, accepting, or receiving political contributions from any person at any time and from engaging in political activity while on duty or at work. Hatch Act violations can result in a range of penalties, including demotion, suspension, removal from employment, a civil fine, and debarment.
