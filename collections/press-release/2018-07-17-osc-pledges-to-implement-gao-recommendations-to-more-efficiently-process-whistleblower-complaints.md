Special Counsel Henry J. Kerner today released the following statement in response to a [recently issued report](https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-18-400) by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommending steps the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) can take to improve its efficiency and effectiveness in achieving positive results for whistleblowers. The report, requested by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, evaluated how OSC reviews whistleblower disclosures and allegations of prohibited personnel practices throughout the federal government. GAO made seven recommendations for how OSC can improve its evaluation of allegations from federal whistleblowers.  

  

**Special Counsel Henry J. Kerner**: “OSC appreciates the significant time and effort GAO expended reviewing our processes and generating this thoughtful report, and we are committed to robust enforcement of the laws entrusted to us. I want to thank Chairman Johnson for his continued support and for requesting that GAO evaluate ways OSC can be even more effective in carrying out its critical mission to protect and support whistleblowers. We concur with all seven GAO recommendations and have already undertaken steps to begin implementing them.”
