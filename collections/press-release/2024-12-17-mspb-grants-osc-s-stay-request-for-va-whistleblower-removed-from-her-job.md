The employee was removed from her job at the VA after she blew the whistle on several alleged violations occurring at the outpatient clinic where she was assigned.

Shortly after she began her employment with the VA, the employee internally disclosed to an Associate Director that a Nurse Manager had been misdirecting agency-owned medical supplies in violation of various laws, rules, and regulations. Approximately 6 months after the employee's disclosures, the Associate Director proposed her termination.

In its [stay request](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://osc.gov/Documents/PPP/Formal%2520Stays/121624_Stay_Request.pdf&data=05%7c02%7c%7c9bb01f43159e438b440908dd1ea8a224%7c39dcbe17c0694d7c8ad7efbbedb5fc55%7c0%7c0%7c638700431837110223%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7c0%7c%7c%7c&sdata=oOoSL4WK1147YtT59cJ8u6nXUiyUwqm1173hnDSqRuY%3D&reserved=0), OSC stated that it believes the agency removed the employee in March 2022 because of her protected whistleblowing activity in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(8). The MSPB granted OSC's stay request finding “reasonable grounds to believe" that the employee's protected disclosures were “a contributing factor in her probationary termination."
