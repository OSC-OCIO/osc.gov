​The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) welcomes Anne M. Wagner, a new Associate Special Counsel. Ms. Wagner is a career member of the Senior Executive Service and will have a diverse portfolio at OSC. She begins at OSC next week.  

“We are pleased to welcome Anne Wagner to OSC. She brings a wealth of experience and expertise on the federal workplace and the merit system,” said Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner. “She has a strong track record of upholding the legal rights of federal employees.”  

  

Ms. Wagner recently completed her term as the Vice Chairman of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), the quasi-judicial agency in the executive branch that resolves personnel disputes within the federal civil service system. Ms. Wagner was instrumental in making MSPB’s processes more transparent and accountable, in particular, by explaining the bases for Board opinions in non-precedential decisions. Along with her colleagues, she also presided over the first oral arguments before the Board in 30 years.  

  

Before her term at the MSPB, Ms. Wagner served as Chair, Vice Chair, Member, and General Counsel for the Government Accountability Office’s Personnel Appeals Board. She also spent nearly 20 years working as an Assistant General Counsel for the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents hundreds of thousands of federal employees. During this time, she led precedent setting litigation challenging policies and practices that violated the rights of federal employees and handled cases arising under the full array of laws governing federal employment. Her federal career began as an attorney focusing on employment law for the General Service Administration’s Office of General Counsel.  

  

“I’m thrilled to be working with Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner and the talented and committed staff at OSC,” said Ms. Wagner. “I firmly believe in OSC’s mission to protect federal merit system principles.”  

  

Ms. Wagner received her bachelor’s degree from the University of Notre Dame and her law degree from the George Washington University School of Law.
