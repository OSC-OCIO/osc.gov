The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) today was recognized for the fourth year in a row as one of the best places to work in the federal government, according to an annual analysis conducted by the Partnership for Public Service and Boston Consulting Group. For its accomplishment, OSC is featured today in a special [edition](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2024/best-places-work-federal-government/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2) of The Washington Post.

The “Best Places to Work" rankings are based on self-reported employee feedback provided each year through the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS).  In its 2023 FEVS [scores](../../~assets/docs/2023-governmentwide-management-report.pdf), OSC ranked as the top agency among its peers in Performance Confidence, measuring employees' belief their organization has an outstanding competitive future, as well as top in Employee Experience, which measures the extent to which employees are engaged by their work and their organization. According to the Best Places [analysis](https://bestplacestowork.org/rankings/detail/?c=FW00), OSC ranked number four overall among small agencies.

“I'm new to OSC so credit for this achievement goes to Henry Kerner and Karen Gorman, both of whom led the agency in the year before my arrival, and to my colleagues," said Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger. “Everyone at OSC knows our hard work is having a real impact by making our government more efficient, fair, and accountable.  It is my hope that OSC will continue to be a place where every employee, like the government whistleblowers we serve, feels heard and empowered to speak up on how we can continue to achieve great results for federal workers and all Americans."​
