​Special Counsel Henry J. Kerner today released the following statement:

“Today on National Whistleblower Appreciation Day, we honor those who have the courage to speak up and fix problems in our government. Whistleblowers are our first line of defense in rooting out waste, fraud, and wrongdoing. Today, we take a moment to honor them and the community that supports them.

“I would also like to acknowledge the staff of OSC who, in the face of unprecedented challenges this year, have continued to excel in their service to federal whistleblowers. Last quarter, while all of our staff were subject to precautionary mandatory telework, OSC obtained 105 favorable actions on behalf of whistleblowers, the highest number on record for a single quarter. OSC is as productive as ever in ensuring federal employees, whistleblowers, and veterans are protected under civil service laws. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, blowing the whistle has the power to save lives. OSC is honored to support these brave individuals and to participate in the celebration of National Whistleblower Appreciation Day."
