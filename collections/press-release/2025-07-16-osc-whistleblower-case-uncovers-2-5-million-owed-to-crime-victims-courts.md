OSC Whistleblower Case Uncovers $2.5 Million Owed to Crime Victims, Courts 

Page Content

​​​Today, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) [notified](../../~assets/documents/di-24-001399---president-letter_redacted.pdf) ​the President and Congress that the Department of Justice’s (DOJ’s) findings in response to a whistleblower disclosure at the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), Federal Correctional Institution Three Rivers in Live Oak, County Texas, appears reasonable. ​

The DOJ’s investigation into the whistleblower’s disclosure found that BOP officials failed to update relevant inmate records and collect nearly $2.5 million in court-ordered financial obligations to crime victims and the courts. Also identified was nearly $70,000 owed by inmates that were no longer collectable due to time limits.  

As a result of the investigation, BOP established inmate repayment plans to collect on the millions owed, instituted monthly reminders to staff to identify inmate financial obligations, and made available additional training resources.

​“Inadequate overs​ight of BOP inmate accounts and financial obligations has been a longstanding problem, and I thank the whistleblower for bringing this matter to OSC’s attention,” said Senior Counsel Charles Baldis​. He continued, “I also encourage DOJ to continue to improve accountability in this area and help ensure that inmates are paying restitution to crime victims, covering child support debts, and fulfilling other court\-ordered obligations.” ​

Given the significance of the disclosure and the risk taken, OSC [encourages](25-104-osc-institutes-new-policy-to-encourage-rewarding-whistleblowers.md) DOJ to offer a monetary reward to the whistleblower consistent with the agency’s existing statutory authority.  ​
