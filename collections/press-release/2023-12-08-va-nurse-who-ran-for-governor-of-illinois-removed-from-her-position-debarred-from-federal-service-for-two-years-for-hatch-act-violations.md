​The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) today announced an initial decision by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) with the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) that imposed significant disciplinary action against Beverly Miles, a nurse working at a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital outside Chicago, Illinois.  Ms. Miles violated the Hatch Act by running in a partisan election for Governor of Illinois and by knowingly soliciting, accepting, and receiving political contributions.  The ALJ's decision found that Ms. Miles knowingly violated the Hatch Act despite warnings from OSC and VA ethics officials.  

Ms. Miles announced her candidacy in early July 2021, and OSC issued her a letter one week later notifying her that she was violating the law.  Despite repeated attempts to have Ms. Miles come into compliance with the law, she refused.  OSC filed a complaint with the MSPB on October 7, 2021.

In its complaint, OSC charged Ms. Miles with two different Hatch Act violations.  The ALJ found that OSC proved both charges.  The ALJ ordered Ms. Miles removed from her position with the VA and imposed a two-year debarment from future federal employment.

**Acting Special Counsel Karen Gorman**: “We applaud the initial decision in this case, which highlights the serious penalties that can be imposed for violations of the Hatch Act." 

_The initial decision will become final on January 9, 2024, pending an opportunity for appeal._
