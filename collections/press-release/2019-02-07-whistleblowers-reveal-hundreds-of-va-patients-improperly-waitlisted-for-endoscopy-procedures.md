The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) has [alerted](../../~assets/documents/DI-18-1683-and-DI-18-1827-Letter-to-President.pdf) the President and Congress to wait time problems associated with endoscopy procedures at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center in Orlando, Florida (Orlando VAMC). Whistleblowers alerted OSC to the unacceptable backlog alleging that approximately 453 veterans at the Orlando VAMC were awaiting endoscopy procedures with wait times exceeding 30 days from the date deemed clinically appropriate by a VA health care provider. OSC referred the matter for investigation to the agency, which [substantiated](../../~assets/documents/di-18-1683-and-di-18-1827-agency-report-\(redacted\).pdf)​ all of the whistleblowers’ allegations.  

  

“I have great admiration for the whistleblowers who brought this serious matter to our attention,” said Special Counsel Henry J. Kerner. “Because of their intrepid allegiance to the VA’s mission, these disclosures ensured that veterans received the care they deserve.”

  

The VA’s report determined that the rate of colonoscopy screenings for at-risk veterans within 180 days or less of identifying positive preliminary indicators was declining. This drop increased the risk of delays in diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. The report further acknowledged that the wait times between preliminary evaluations and colonoscopies appeared to be increasing, and thus, raising the risk for other medical conditions to worsen and complicating the ability to complete the colonoscopy.

  

As a result of the investigation, the VA contacted 245 veterans who were patients on the waitlist at the Orlando VAMC and offered them community care to ensure they have access to timely endoscopy procedures.
