Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger today released the following statement after the assassination attempt injuring former President Donald Trump.

“Political violence is abhorrent and anathema to democracy and the rule of law," Dellinger said.  “Since the shooting, vital questions have been raised about the security breakdown.  I applaud Congress for taking the lead on investigating how this failure could have happened. Senior federal officials are being called to testify.  But any federal employee with knowledge of potential wrongdoing, or with knowledge of any ongoing issues that could endanger protectees or the public, can help.  Congress, the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General, and the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) are all places where federal employees can report misconduct or meaningful dangers to public health and safety."

OSC reviews whistleblower disclosures within the executive branch reported by current or former federal employees and applicants for federal employment. Such disclosures may be in one or more of the following categories:

*   A violation of a law, rule, or regulation;
*   Gross mismanagement;
*   A gross waste of funds;
*   An abuse of authority;
*   A substantial and specific danger to public health or safety; and/or
*   Censorship related to research, analysis, or technical information.

Federal law establishes protections for disclosures made to OSC. This process is intended to safeguard the confidentiality of the whistleblower and ensure that any potential wrongdoing is investigated and, where necessary, corrected.
