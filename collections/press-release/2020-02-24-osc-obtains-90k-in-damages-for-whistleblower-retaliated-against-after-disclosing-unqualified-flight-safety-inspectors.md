​The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) today announced a recent settlement agreement reached with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), including $90,000 in compensatory damages, for an Aviation Safety Inspector who was retaliated against for blowing the whistle on unqualified flight safety inspectors.

The whistleblower [disclosed](19-18-faa-inspectors-training.md) that flight inspectors were certifying pilots and conducting safety “check rides" even though they lacked the necessary formal training and certifications required to perform that oversight.

The FAA Office of Audit & Evaluation (AAE) substantiated the whistleblower's allegations, calling into question the operational review of several aircraft, including the Boeing 737 MAX and the Gulfstream VII.

AAE also found that after disclosing the problem, the whistleblower faced retaliation. The whistleblower decided to take a new position in another city in order to escape what he believed was pervasive harassment.  After he made the disclosures, his managers also allegedly removed his duties and denied training requests, flight certifications, and job training opportunities.

With OSC's assistance, the parties were able to settle the case and FAA agreed to pay consequential and compensatory damages in the amount of $90,000.  During the investigation, the whistleblower's then-manager retired, so OSC did not seek disciplinary action.
