​The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) today [sent letters](../../~assets/documents/OSC-Case-File-No.-DI-19-2715---Letter-to-the-President_Redacted.pdf) to the President and Congress outlining how a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) whistleblower worked with OSC to ensure veterans were fully reimbursed for ambulance transportation services to a VA medical facility in Harlingen, Texas. The whistleblower alleged the VA failed to pay for the ambulance bills and did not reimburse eligible veterans who paid out-of-pocket. By law, the VA is required to pay transportation costs for veterans eligible for the Beneficiary Travel Program. An [investigation](../../~assets/documents/OSC-File-No.-DI-19-2715-Texas-Valley-Coastal-Bend-HCS---Report_Redacted.pdf) by the agency substantiated the allegation citing delays in the VA's processing of private vendor claims.

The report made several recommendations, and in July, the VA confirmed to OSC that all invoices had been paid and that new invoices were being processed and paid in fewer than 14 days. Further, all staff members at the Texas facility had received training on processing and payment procedures.

“Ambulance services can be very costly. Veterans who are already dealing with serious health problems should not also have to bear the stress and financial burden of paying these large bills out-of-pocket," said **Special Counsel Henry J. Kerner**. “I thank the whistleblower for bringing this matter to OSC and the VA for implementing recommendations from the report."
