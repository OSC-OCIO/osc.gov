​Today, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) [reported](../../documents/public%20files.md)​ to the White House and Congress on an internal investigation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). OSC requested the investigation and report after receiving information from NRC engineer Lawrence Criscione that NRC failed to require the Oconee Nuclear Station in South Carolina, and 18 other nuclear power stations located downstream from dams, to act appropriately to protect against the risk of flooding in the event of dam failures.  

  

NRC’s internal investigation found that the regulatory and oversight agency acted appropriately and within the scope of its authority to ensure that the public is adequately protected. After multiple, detailed assessments of potential flood scenarios, NRC concluded that the current flood protection barrier at the Oconee Nuclear Station provides adequate protection. At each of the 19 sites identified, plants are implementing strategies to mitigate the effects of potential external floods.  

  

Despite NRC’s assurances, Mr. Criscione and other subject matter experts concurring with him remain concerned about the investigative findings, including the NRC’s assessment of the risk of flooding at Oconee and the other nuclear power plants located downstream from dams.

  

“I acknowledge that NRC’s work to monitor and address the risk of flooding at nuclear power plants is ongoing,” said Acting Special Counsel Tristan L. Leavitt. “I encourage NRC to carefully consider Mr. Criscione’s and the other subject matter experts’ comments and utilize their expertise, particularly with respect to the assessment of the flood barrier height for Oconee.”
