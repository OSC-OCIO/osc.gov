Whistleblowers Expose Hazardous Workplace Conditions at USDA Research Facility

Page Content

​Today, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) [notified ​](../../publicfiles.md)the President and Congress that a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) investigation substantiated serious safety and maintenance failures at the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) in Maryland. In their disclosure to OSC, the whistleblowers, who are BARC employees, alleged that the agency's leadership failed to adequately address complaints concerning workplace conditions since 2017 resulting in unsafe conditions throughout its 300 buildings and structures.

The agency investigation largely substantiated the whistleblowers' allegations, finding pervasive safety deficiencies in many of the facilities and structures at BARC, including a lack of running water, malfunctioning elevators, inadequate heating and cooling, widespread water damage, mold and non-functioning fire suppression systems in dozens of buildings.  

In response, USDA established an oversight and leadership response team and completed nearly 60 corrective actions. USDA also redirected funds toward modernizing and repairing the neglected infrastructure. A new permanent BARC Director has been selected, and a new BARC Master Plan has been developed.  

“I thank the whistleblowers for bringing these allegations to OSC and [recommend](../../~assets/docs/osc-monetary-policy-re-whistleblowers-52025.pdf) that the USDA recognize their contributions to improve government efficiency and the safety of BARC workers and consider issuing a monetary reward," said Senior Counsel Charles Baldis. ​
