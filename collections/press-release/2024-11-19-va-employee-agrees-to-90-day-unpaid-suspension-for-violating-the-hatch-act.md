The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) today announced a settlement agreement, including a 90-day unpaid suspension, reached with a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) employee whom OSC alleged violated the Hatch Act.

As part of the settlement agreement, the employee admitted to posting, or acquiesced in the posting of, numerous Facebook posts on his personal account that solicited contributions for candidates for partisan political office.  The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees at all times from knowingly soliciting, accepting, or receiving a contribution for a political party or candidate for partisan political office.

OSC's Hatch Act complaint further alleged that a number of the solicitations were posted while the employee was on duty or in the federal workplace, which is also prohibited under the law. The employee agreed to settle the case by accepting a 90 consecutive-day suspension without pay.

“The Hatch Act includes a 24-7 prohibition on federal employees soliciting donations for partisan political campaigns," said Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger. “This is a bright line rule and OSC will seek discipline when a federal employee knowingly flouts the law."
