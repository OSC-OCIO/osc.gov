The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) today unveiled a new series of videos aimed at educating federal agencies and non-federal organizations on prohibited personnel practices, the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, the Hatch Act, whistleblower disclosures, and alternative dispute resolution.   

The goal of the videos is to promote understanding and knowledge of each of the areas of law within OSC's jurisdiction. The new videos are also intended to serve as a tool to learn about the rights of federal employees specifically enforced by OSC.   

OSC is an independent, investigative, and prosecutorial agency. Current and former federal employees, including probationary employees and applicants for federal employment, can file a complaint with OSC at [www.osc.gov](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http://www.osc.gov/&data=05%7c01%7cZKurz%40osc.gov%7c03363cd3047c4bf9948f08db1f23c19d%7c39dcbe17c0694d7c8ad7efbbedb5fc55%7c0%7c0%7c638138010700062668%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7c3000%7c%7c%7c&sdata=y%2BNcOg/s8O7W2nL%2B8GsIxelW%2BwiNJJEspI7WTiQxyx0%3D&reserved=0). Employees do not need attorneys to file a complaint. OSC will review all complaints, investigate allegations of prohibited personnel practices, and where appropriate, seek corrective and/or disciplinary action.

The videos are available on [OSC's YouTube page](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://www.youtube.com/%40officeofspecialcounsel-com6925&data=05%7c01%7cZKurz%40osc.gov%7c03363cd3047c4bf9948f08db1f23c19d%7c39dcbe17c0694d7c8ad7efbbedb5fc55%7c0%7c0%7c638138010700062668%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7c3000%7c%7c%7c&sdata=wOjUbusyu2TOohEsucc6ieKAV60kzk48FCXHsTR00ug%3D&reserved=0) and at [www.osc.gov](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http://www.osc.gov/&data=05%7c01%7cZKurz%40osc.gov%7c03363cd3047c4bf9948f08db1f23c19d%7c39dcbe17c0694d7c8ad7efbbedb5fc55%7c0%7c0%7c638138010700062668%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7c3000%7c%7c%7c&sdata=y%2BNcOg/s8O7W2nL%2B8GsIxelW%2BwiNJJEspI7WTiQxyx0%3D&reserved=0).  Viewers can download designated content for off-line use.
