​The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) today was recognized as the second highest-ranked “Best Places to Work" out of 29 small federal agencies, and the top small federal executive agency, according to a comprehensive analysis conducted by the Partnership for Public Service and Boston Consulting Group.    

According to the report's authors, many issues – from pay to teamwork to work-life balance – influence how employees view their workplaces and rate their engagement.  Effective leadership was once again the key driver of employee engagement across government in 2020. The survey breaks federal agencies up by size to compare relative data. Employees at OSC gave agency leadership an overall score of 81 out of 100, the third highest among comparable agencies and OSC's highest score since survey results were first collected in 2012. In 2020, OSC had the highest rank of all small agencies in categories measuring teamwork, innovation, and employee recognition, and the second-highest rank for effective senior leadership and effective supervisors.

“I am extremely proud to work with such dedicated public servants and effective supervisors who have overcome great challenges, persevered, and excelled in fulfilling OSC's important mission over the last year, which was difficult in so many ways," said **Special Counsel Henry J. Kerner**. “At OSC, we try very hard to create a positive work environment, which translates into better outcomes for our whistleblowers and other stakeholders. Not only has OSC increased its efficiency, attaining a higher number of favorable outcomes for stakeholders, but its employees now report higher job satisfaction, which has been recognized by the Partnership and Boston Consulting. We look forward to building on these terrific numbers in the coming years."
