---

​​The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) is committed to providing access to the content on our website for individuals with disabilities.  Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, requires us to ensure that Federal employees and members of the public with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that of Federal employees and members of the public without disabilities.  

We will make every effort to comply with the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998 (29 U.S.C. 794) and the accessibility standards for implementing Section 508 issued by the U.S. Access Board. 

If you use assistive technology and have trouble accessing information on [osc.gov,](http://www.osc.gov/) please contact us.  Please include the URL (web address) of the information you tried to access and your contact information.  We will respond to you as soon as possible and do what we can to provide you with the information you need. 

To learn more about accessibility requirements for electronic and information technology, see the Access Board's Section 508 standards.  Questions about accessibility of electronic and information technology may be directed to [508@access-board.gov](mailto:508assistance@osc.gov). Additional information on Section 508 can be found at [www.section508.gov](mailto:508assistance@osc.gov). 

If you have any questions or a complaint relating to the accessibility of content on our website that interferes with your ability to communicate with OSC, or your ability to access information or communicate with us, please contact our 508 Program Manager, Shola Kalejaiye at [508assistance@osc.gov](mailto:508assistance@osc.gov) for assistance. 

An individual may file an equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaint if they believe OSC is not compliant with Section 508. The complaint can be filed with OSC's EEO Office.
