​Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests must be submitted in writing by U.S. postal mail or other delivery service, e-mail, fax, or through our [Public Access Link (PAL)](https://efoia.osc.gov/) portal. The PAL allows you to submit a FOIA request online, as well as receive confirmations and updates on your pendi​ng request. (Online requests require use of an access account. [Click here​](https://efoia.osc.gov/) to create your account.)​ If sent by U.S. postal mail or other delivery service, your letter should clearly be marked "FOIA Request" and be addressed to:

FOIA Officer  
U.S. Office of Special Counsel  
1730 M St., N.W. (Suite 218)  
Washington, DC 20036-4505

If sending by fax, include a cover sheet clearly ​marked "FOIA Request" and send to: (202) 254-3711.  If sending by email, include "FOIA Request" in the subject line and send to:  FOIARequest@osc.gov 

Whether sent by mail, email or fax, your FOIA request will not be considered to have been received by OSC until it reaches the agency’s FOIA Office.

You should also be aware that making a FOIA request will be considered to be an agreement by you to pay all fees chargeable und​er the FOIA, up to and including $25.00, unless you ask for and receive a waiver of fees.​​
