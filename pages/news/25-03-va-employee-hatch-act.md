The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) today announces that a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) employee who violated the Hatch Act by sharing Facebook posts promoting partisan political fundraisers has agreed to a 70-day unpaid suspension.

As part of a settlement agreement, the employee admitted to posting 12 Facebook messages, including while on duty, that advertised, promoted, or otherwise disseminated information about political fundraisers for a candidate for state legislature whom she supported. The Hatch Act generally prohibits federal employees from knowingly soliciting, accepting, or receiving political contributions at any time and from engaging in political activity while on duty or at work. That prohibition applies with respect to candidates for partisan political office at the federal, state, and local level. 

In some of the posts, the VA employee did not add any of her own text, but instead only shared fundraising posts made by a candidate's campaign. However, sharing a campaign's fundraising post—or forwarding a campaign's fundraising email—is a violation even when an employee does not personally author any text related to the solicitation.

“Federal employees are obligated to stay in compliance of the Hatch Act, which includes a prohibition on political activity while on duty, and a round-the-clock prohibition on soliciting donations for partisan political candidates," said Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger.
