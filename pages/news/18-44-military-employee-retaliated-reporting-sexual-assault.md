The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) has resolved a whistleblower retaliation case for a military civilian employee who was removed from their position and issued a “no contact” order after reporting a sexual assault against one of their subordinates as well as contracting issues. The whistleblower, a military civilian employee, recalls “because I simply did the right thing, lived our Core Values, I became a victim . . . I was isolated and humiliated.”  

  

After receiving this whistleblower’s complaint, OSC conducted an investigation and worked closely with new leadership at the whistleblower’s agency to resolve the case, including restoring the whistleblower’s job and reputation. “OSC evaluated the facts and took actions that will affect my organization for years to come,” the whistleblower says. “I now have a job where I can truly influence the future and advise senior leaders at all levels to make sure there is accountability and respect for those who stand strong and do the right thing.”

  

As part of its investigation, OSC examined the evidence, reviewed thousands of documents, and interviewed over a dozen witnesses, including an on-site visit to the whistleblower’s Base to meet with individuals having knowledge about the facts underlying the case. According to the whistleblower, it was worth the wait. “I will forever be grateful not only for the hard work, dedication and absolute professionalism of the personnel from OSC . . . but the honest and genuine way they conducted themselves and worked through very difficult issues . . . absolutely extraordinary! They have changed my life and the lives of countless others,” the whistleblower said.  

  

“This employee was unfairly punished for doing what was right and reporting allegations of misconduct,” said **Special Counsel Henry J. Kerner**. “After being effectively demoted and isolated, OSC was able to get them reassigned to their position and made whole.”
