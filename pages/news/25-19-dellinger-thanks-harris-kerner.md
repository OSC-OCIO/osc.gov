MSPB is in an extremely strong position now because of Cathy's dedication and talents, and we look forward to her continued service as a member of the Board. Much credit also goes to members Henry Kerner and Ray Limon. 

“I also want to congratulate Henry Kerner on being tapped to serve as Acting Chair. Henry was my predecessor here at the Office of Special Counsel and was an outstanding leader of OSC. He is an exceptional choice to chair MSPB and I wish him all the best in the role."
