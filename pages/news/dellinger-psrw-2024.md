This week is Public Service Recognition Week, a time each year when we show our particular appreciation for public servants across governments (federal, tribal, state, and local) for their vast contributions. As Special Counsel, I'm grateful for and proud to recognize the hard and incredibly effective work of my OSC colleagues.

OSC has secured record numbers of favorable actions for federal employees in recent years, and we are once again on track meet or exceed these numbers this year. OSC staff's dedication and commitment to serving our nation is inspiring. This year, OSC is one of the 81 federal agencies to sign onto the Public Service Recognition Week [co-chair letter](../../~assets/documents/PSRW24_CoChairLetter-11.pdf). 

I would like to take this opportunity to thank every member of the OSC team, as well as the dedicated federal employees who come to OSC for assistance. It is an honor to be part of a workforce with so many talented and devoted public servants.​
