​Special Counsel Henry J. Kerner today released the following statement in recognition of National Whistleblower Appreciation Day:

  

“Today on National Whistleblower Appreciation Day, we honor those who have the courage to speak up when they see a problem. Whistleblowers safeguard our workplace rights and hold government officials accountable for malfeasance.

  

“As advocates for whistleblowers, we must continue to offer strong support and protection. Individuals will only disclose wrongdoing under two circumstances: One, they must reasonably believe the problem they expose will be fixed, and two, they must feel protected from retaliation. We at OSC do both. We listen to their disclosures, review evidence, and protect them from retaliation.

  

“OSC is honored participate in the celebration of National Whistleblower Appreciation Day and will continue to work with Congress to strengthen whistleblower protections. Whistleblowers are our front-line in rooting out fraud and wrongdoing at all levels of government. Today, we take a moment to honor them and the community that supports them.”
