The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) today announced key staff departures and arrivals in its Washington D.C. office:

**Osborne Mack - Retirement**

Osborne has worked for OSC, since November of 1985 and assisted eight Special Counsels.  Throughout his OSC tenure, Osborne demonstrated the qualities of dedication to duty, integrity, and excellence that are the hallmarks of public service. For IPD DC, and for the many Associate Special Counsels who have worked with Osborne, accuracy and attention to detail have defined his daily work.​  

“Osborne embodies the spirit of OSC and deserves recognition for his many contributions during his longstanding service," said Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger. “When his retirement was announced, it was immediately clear how much Osborne means to everyone here at OSC. He will be dearly missed, but we wish him the best and always consider him part of the OSC family."  

**Shirine Moazed - Retirement**

Shirine had been with OSC since 1997 in a number of different roles, most recently as Chief of OSC's Diversity, Outreach and Training (DOT) program, which she helped grow and develop.  This includes OSC's 2302(c) certification program, which increases federal employees' awareness of their rights and responsibilities under civil service and whistleblower protection laws while helping to prevent violations by federal agencies.  Shirine has delivered upwards of 1,000 training presentations during her tenure and has received numerous accolades for her efforts.  She previously served as the Chief of the Washington Field Office, supervising a staff of attorneys and investigators for over ten years. She has also been a frequent presenter at conferences with a focus on protecting whistleblowers from retaliation.  

“Shirine is a truly gifted lawyer and presenter.  She has aided the work of the entire executive branch through countless training sessions," said Special Counsel Dellinger. “Shirine's contributions to our Diversity, Outreach, and Training Unit have made OSC a more effective and transparent agency. We wish Shirine the best in her well-deserved retirement."  

**Nicole Brightbill – New Opportunity**

Nicole joined OSC as Senior Counsel in August 2021 and was later appointed the Principal Deputy Special Counsel where she skillfully handled the myriad programmatic and operational issues facing OSC. Nicole previously served at the U.S. Department of Labor Office of the Assistant Secretary for Policy, where she was Senior Counsel. She is departing OSC for a new opportunity as Chief Counsel to a board member of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.   

“We thank Nicole for her dedicated service to OSC and wish her the best in her new role," said Special Counsel Dellinger.  “Nicole is a supremely talented attorney with great judgment.  She has been an invaluable resource as I begin my tenure at OSC."

Replacing Shirine as Chief of DOT will be her former deputy, **Ashley Tease**. Ashley has worked for OSC since September 2014, and previously served as an Attorney-Advisor in OSC's Investigation and Prosecution Division (IPD).  

“Ashley is incredibly knowledgeable and a presenter of the highest caliber," said Special Counsel Dellinger. “With her experience as DOT's deputy chief, I know that the unit is in the best hands possible.  I'm very happy to see Ashley have this opportunity and grateful for her continuing contributions to OSC."  

Last, we are pleased to welcome **Corey Williams** who will be assisting with congressional inquiries and legislative affairs. Corey has extensive experience with Congressional lawmakers, most recently working for IAC where she advocated on behalf of businesses and consumers on legislative policy issues. Corey has also advocated for the National Education Association and the American Library Association. Corey earned a Master of Arts degree in Library and Information Science from The University of Iowa and a Bachelor of Arts from The University of Iowa.  

“Corey has great experience working with Congress, and OSC looks forward to utilizing her expertise to ensure we partner with and effectively communicate with lawmakers about OSC's important work," said Special Counsel Dellinger.
