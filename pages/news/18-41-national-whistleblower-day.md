**Special Counsel Henry J. Kerner**: “At OSC we aim to serve whistleblowers daily, but today, on National Whistleblower Day, we want to take an extra moment to honor those individuals who find the courage to step forward and report wrongdoing. We truly appreciate the people who come to OSC, including those we can cite by name and those who come anonymously, because they are the front line in safeguarding our workplace rights and keeping government accountable.  

  

“OSC is honored to be participating in the celebration of National Whistleblower Day and looks forward to continuing to work with Congress to strengthen what is already a tremendous national whistleblower program. Today we give a special thanks to whistleblowers and the whole community that supports them, as we all work together to make the federal government a shining model of efficient and effective service.”
