The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) today announced it has been [granted](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/nonprecedential/Gradnigo_MichelleCB-1208-25-0006-U-2_Order_on_Stay_Extension_Request.pdf&data=05%7c02%7c%7c456990d08c0d4ac1ff1408dd40875b99%7c39dcbe17c0694d7c8ad7efbbedb5fc55%7c0%7c0%7c638737672302629585%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7c0%7c%7c%7c&sdata=7q0popO4NY6T8T1dXTgT/2cfCOnN1Y3Q05fWRHOBBgU%3D&reserved=0) an indefinite stay by the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) halting the probationary removal of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) whistleblower. The employee [alleged](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://osc.gov/News/Pages/25-13-VA-stay-granted.aspx&data=05%7c02%7c%7c456990d08c0d4ac1ff1408dd40875b99%7c39dcbe17c0694d7c8ad7efbbedb5fc55%7c0%7c0%7c638737672302643506%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7c0%7c%7c%7c&sdata=DxRjeNGZhMwcTpRAhwIwfK3eXzPc8G4z0c4Gb2/CnpE%3D&reserved=0) the VA removed her after she made several disclosures concerning violations of VA property management rules.

OSC investigated the employee's allegations and found strong evidence to support the removal was in retaliation for her whistleblowing, under 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(8). OSC submitted a report of prohibited personnel practices to the VA Secretary in November 2024. Despite the report's findings, the VA did not agree to reinstate the employee. OSC then filed a complaint with MSPB seeking corrective action.

Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger offered credit and thanks to the OSC attorneys who worked on this matter, including Dustin Frankel.
