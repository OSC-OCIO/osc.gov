During Pride Month, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) reminds federal employees that if they believe they have been subjected to a prohibited personnel practice (PPP) based on sexual orientation or gender identity, they may seek assistance from OSC.

OSC is an independent investigative and prosecutorial agency that receives and investigates complaints alleging PPPs, and wherever appropriate, seeks corrective action or discipline.

“OSC is committed to helping government employees who have faced adverse employment actions based on their sexual orientation or gender identity," said Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger. “Discrimination in the federal workplace will not be tolerated."

Historically, OSC has played an important role in protecting the employment rights of LGBTQI+ federal workers. Before these rights were protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, OSC used its independent authority to address discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. OSC works alongside other federal agencies like the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board to protect all federal employees from discrimination on these bases.  

OSC strongly supports the protections passed by Congress ensuring that no government manager can discriminate against employees on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity, or related to conduct which does not adversely affect their performance. These are broad protections which allow OSC to assist federal employees who believe they have been subjected to discrimination.

OSC has authority to seek stays of personnel actions against complainants while investigations are pending. If OSC determines a PPP has occurred, it can obtain full corrective action for complainants and seek disciplinary action against alleged wrongdoers.

To file a PPP complaint with OSC or ask questions about the PPP process, please visit OSC's website at [www.osc.gov](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http://www.osc.gov/&data=05%7c02%7c%7c1bade756b87943f8d84208dc8c7d7ef2%7c39dcbe17c0694d7c8ad7efbbedb5fc55%7c0%7c0%7c638539717853535375%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7c0%7c%7c%7c&sdata=RMO0Lr9lzaH1mUAyPn8aY1MW0qK%2BaPIRFCg3n6BclgM%3D&reserved=0).
