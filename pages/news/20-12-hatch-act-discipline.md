**U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)**:

*   A VA employee escorted a Senate candidate and his campaign's political director through a VA facility. The employee had twice received Hatch Act advice about candidate visits before engaging in the prohibited activity.  The since-retired employee agreed to pay a $1000 civil fine.
*   While on duty or in a federal workplace, a VA employee posted to Twitter dozens of tweets and retweets directed toward the success or failure of candidates for President and the U.S. Senate. The employee had prior knowledge of the Hatch Act and agreed to serve a 25-day unpaid suspension.
*   A VA employee used his official title when endorsing the campaign of a Hawaii state representative running for partisan political office. The employee agreed to serve a 7-day unpaid suspension.

**Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)**:

*   An FAA employee solicited political contributions for the union's political action committee from two other FAA employees while on duty and in the workplace. The employee had prior knowledge of the Hatch Act and agreed to serve a 30-day unpaid suspension.

**U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)**:

*   A USDA employee, while on duty, posted numerous partisan political messages to his personal Facebook account expressing opposition towards presidential candidates and a political party. The employee had knowledge of the Hatch Act and knew his conduct violated the law. He had also previously been disciplined twice for posting on social media while on duty.  The employee agreed to serve a 30-day unpaid suspension.
