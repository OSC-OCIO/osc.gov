Each year the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) obtains hundreds of favorable actions for employees who are retaliated against for making protected disclosures. OSC highlights some recent cases in which OSC succeeded in getting federal agencies to redress the retaliatory actions the agencies took against whistleblowers. For more information about OSC's work in this area, our most recent annual report to Congress can be [found here](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://osc.gov/Documents/Resources/Congressional%2520Matters/Annual%2520Reports%2520to%2520Congress/FY%25202022%2520Annual%2520Report%2520to%2520Congress.pdf&data=05%7c02%7c%7c06fad8891d4b40471d0608dc33d4a797%7c39dcbe17c0694d7c8ad7efbbedb5fc55%7c0%7c1%7c638442235685721170%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7c0%7c%7c%7c&sdata=0/EY222kTk3xqTFVX3rRCNOqJTCq2mEmYYLEAnesvC0%3D&reserved=0).

**Promotion following Non-selection**  
An employee alleged they were not selected for multiple positions in retaliation for making protected disclosures.  Following OSC's investigation, the parties reached a settlement wherein the agency agreed to promote the employee and pay $25,000 for attorneys' fees and other damages. 

**Damages for Involuntary Reassignment**  
OSC investigated an employee's allegations that they were involuntary reassigned to a different job because they disclosed violations of law.  The agency agreed to reinstate the employee to their former position, restore leave, and provide over $100,000 in damages. 

**Reinstatement to a Supervisory Detail**  
Alleging whistleblower retaliation, an employee challenged the cancelation of a supervisory detail after disclosing violations of agency policy. OSC requested, and the agency agreed, to pay $10,000 in damages, offer another supervisory detail, provide training on prohibited personnel practices to management, and remove the involved officials from future personnel decisions concerning the employee.

**Damages and Rescinded Suspension**  
An employee alleged retaliation for reporting co-workers for waste and other wrongdoing and for cooperating with an OSC investigation. OSC investigated the employee's claim that retaliatory actions included suspension, non-selection, and being placed on administrative leave pending an investigation into alleged wrongful conduct.  The parties entered into a settlement agreement that included $75,000 in compensatory damages, rescission of the suspension, and a higher performance rating.

OSC applauds the parties for their willingness to resolve these matters.
