Prohibited Personnel Practices

The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) obtained a 45-day stay from the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) of a proposed removal of a National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) employee

On Friday, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) obtained a 45-day stay from the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) of a proposed removal of a National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) employee. The employee, Diane Rector, filed a claim with OSC alleging that her agency retaliated against her for blowing the whistle. 

A stay provides temporary relief to complainants while OSC investigates their prohibited personnel practice claim (for example, whistleblower retaliation). A grant of a stay request is not a finding on the merits of the claim; rather, OSC requests a stay when it has a reasonable belief that a prohibited personnel practice may have occurred. 

The MSPB’s stay order, which contains further details, can be found [here​](https://www.mspb.gov/netsearch/viewdocs.aspx?docnumber=1265705&version=1270759&application=ACROBAT).​
