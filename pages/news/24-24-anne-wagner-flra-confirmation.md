Today, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) and Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger congratulate Anne Wagner on her Senate confirmation to be a Member of the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA). For 9 years, Anne has been Associate Special Counsel, most recently leading OSC's General Law Division, which includes overseeing several programmatic units, including the Disclosure Unit, Retaliation and Disclosure Unit, Alternative Dispute Resolution, the Hatch Act Unit, Diversity Outreach and Training Unit, Case Review Division, and the USERRA Unit.

"We extend our warmest congratulations to Anne Wagner on her confirmation to the FLRA," said Special Counsel Dellinger. “I thank Anne for her many years of exceptional service and leadership here at OSC, and for all her help and wisdom as I began my term. Anne's brilliance, her enduring dedication to public service, and her commitment to protecting federal employees' rights will be a tremendous asset to the FLRA. We wish Anne all the best as she takes on this vital new role." 

The FLRA is an independent administrative federal agency created by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. Wagner will be one of three members, joining Chairman Susan Tsui Grundmann and Member Colleen Duffy Kiko, who was renominated for a second term and is awaiting Senate confirmation. FLRA is responsible for promoting and managing relationships among federal agencies, labor organizations, and employees.

Before coming to OSC, Anne was the Vice Chair of the Merit Systems Protection Board, the independent, quasi-judicial agency in the executive branch that resolves personnel disputes within the federal civil service system. She also served as Chair, Vice Chair, Member, and General Counsel for the Government Accountability Office's Personnel Appeals Board.

Prior to these roles, Anne spent nearly 20 years working as an Assistant General Counsel for the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents hundreds of thousands of federal workers. During this time, she led precedent setting litigation challenging policies and practices that violated the rights of federal employees and handled cases arising under the full array of laws governing federal employment. Her federal career began as an attorney focusing on employment law for the General Services Administration's Office of General Counsel.
