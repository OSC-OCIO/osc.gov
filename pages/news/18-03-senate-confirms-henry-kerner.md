​The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) announces that Henry Kerner of California has received Senate confirmation of his Presidential nomination as Special Counsel, Office of Special Counsel.  

  

Mr. Kerner graduated from Harvard Law School and spent 18 years working as a career prosecutor in California. In 2011, he relocated to the Washington, D.C., area and joined the staff of the House Oversight Committee, under Chairman Darrell Issa, the chief investigative committee of the United States House of Representatives. Under Chairman Issa, and later, in a return engagement, under Chairman Chaffetz, he led investigations of the Federal bureaucracy and fought on behalf of whistleblowers to protect American taxpayers. In the interim, Mr. Kerner was the Staff Director for Ranking Member Sen. John McCain on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the lead investigative committee of the Senate.

  

He assumes OSC leadership from his position as a Vice President at Cause of Action, a nonpartisan oversight group committed to exposing waste, fraud and abuse in the Federal Government and which has worked with whistleblower and good government groups throughout the country.

  

OSC’s Principal Deputy Special Counsel and Acting Special Counsel Tristan Leavitt welcomes Mr. Kerner. “Henry brings a deep commitment and integrity aligned with OSC’s mission. We are excited to welcome him shortly, and I look forward to working closely with him to safeguard whistleblowers and promote accountability in government.”
