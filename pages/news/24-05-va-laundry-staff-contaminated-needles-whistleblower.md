​The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) today [alerted](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http://sp19-app-02/Documents/Public%20Files/FY24/DI-23-000571/DI-23-000571%20Letter%20to%20the%20President%20Redacted.pdf&data=05%7c02%7c%7c516de66219a6480bdf1208dc2d73d68f%7c39dcbe17c0694d7c8ad7efbbedb5fc55%7c0%7c0%7c638435222745926033%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7c0%7c%7c%7c&sdata=rOJP2VSM8wE3YZtU%2BzJbL1yDpNGUgdAlpSVArt03PVc%3D&reserved=0) the President and Congress to significant corrective action taken by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Richmond, Virginia (Richmond VAMC) that will improve the safety of Laundry Service operations after a whistleblower disclosed an uptick in contaminated needles found in laundry bins.

The whistleblower, a Machine Operator at the Richmond VAMC Laundry Service, disclosed to OSC that employees found used syringes containing blood or other substances in soiled textiles received from patient care units. A VA investigative report [substantiated](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http://sp19-app-02/Documents/Public%20Files/FY24/DI-23-000571/DI-23-000571%20VA%20-%20Report_Redacted.pdf&data=05%7c02%7c%7c516de66219a6480bdf1208dc2d73d68f%7c39dcbe17c0694d7c8ad7efbbedb5fc55%7c0%7c0%7c638435222745933074%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7c0%7c%7c%7c&sdata=pJ52sPRuOoCo%2BPKZ/9Ru3d6b/veEO28cniM8lPlmags%3D&reserved=0) the allegation, finding that risks to employees were not adequately managed. For example, the Richmond VAMC failed to provide Laundry Service employees with appropriate protective gloves, which the investigation found constituted a specific danger to health and safety.

The report recommended significant corrective actions, including tracking and reporting linens sent with medical waste; training clinical staff on proper disposal of syringes and debris; developing an SOP for reporting items found in soiled linens; providing training and protective gloves for Laundry Service employees; and establishing monthly Infection Control inspections in the Laundry Service. 

“I thank the whistleblower for coming forward with these serious allegations," said Acting Special Counsel Karen Gorman. “The VA has initiated strong corrective measures to protect the health and safety of Laundry Service employees, patients, and the public."
