​If you believe your USERRA rights may have been violated, you may file a formal complaint with the [U.S. Department of Labor, Veterans Employment & Training Service (DOL-VETS)](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/vets):

- The DOL-VETS USERRA complaint form, VETS-1010, and instructions for completing and submitting it, are available [here](https://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/vets/vetpref/1010.htm);
- The contact information for your local DOL-VETS office is available [here](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/vets/about/regionaloffices);

​If you choose to file a USERRA complaint, DOL-VETS ​will investigate and attempt to resolve it; if efforts at resolution are unsuccessful, you may have the option of seeking representation from either OSC (if the complaint involves a federal executive agency, with certain limited exceptions) or the [U.S. Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) (if the complaint involves a state, local, or private employer).​​

At various stages before and during the complaint process, you may also have the option of filing an action with the ​[Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB](https://www.mspb.gov/)) (if the complaint involves a federal executive agency, with certain limited exceptions) or in federal or state court (if the complaint involves a state, local, or private employer).​​
