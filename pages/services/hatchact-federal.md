title: Federal Employee Hatch Act Information
permalink: /serviceshatchact-federal/
---

Except for the President and Vice President, all federal civilian executive branch employees are covered by the Hatch Act, including employees of the U.S. Postal Service. Even part-time employees are covered by the Act, and all employees continue to be covered while on annual leave, sick leave, leave without pay, or furlough. However, employees who work on an occasional or irregular basis, or who are special government employees, as defined in title 18 U.S.C. § 202(a), are subject to the restrictions only when they are engaged in government business. Federal employees fall within two categories under the Hatch Act, Further Restricted and Less Restricted.​

## Less Restricted Employees

- Who Are Less Restricted Employees?
- Prohibited Activities for Less Restricted Employees
- Permitted Activities for Less Restricted Employees

## Who Are Less Restricted Employees?

​Most federal executive branch employees (except those listed under Further Restricted Employees) are considered Less Restricted under the Hatch Act. Less Restricted employees may take an active part in partisan political management or partisan political campaigns.​

## Prohibited Activities for Less Restricted Employees

​Less restricted federal employees may not:

- Use their official authority or influence to interfere with or affect the result of an election, by for example:

- ​Using their official titles or positions while engaged in political activity
- Inviting subordinate employees to political events or otherwise suggesting to subordinates that they attend political events or undertake any partisan political activity

- Solicit, accept or receive a donation or contribution for a partisan political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group by for example:

- Hosting a political fundraiser
- Collecting contributions or selling tickets to political fundraising functions\*

- Be candidates for partisan political office
- Knowingly solicit or discourage the participation in any political activity of anyone who has business pending before their employing office
- Engage in political activity – i.e., activity directed at the success or failure of a political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group – while the employee is on duty, in any federal room or building, while wearing a uniform or official insignia, or using any federally owned or leased vehicle. For example, while at work employees may not:

- Distribute campaign materials or items
- Display campaign materials or items
- Perform campaign related chores
- ​Wear or display partisan political buttons, t-shirts, signs, or other items
- Make political contributions to a partisan political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group
- Post a comment to a blog or a social media site that advocates for or against a partisan political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group
- ​Use any email account or social media to distribute, send, or forward content that advocates for or against a partisan political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group

​\* Soliciting, accepting, or receiving such donations or contributions may be done so long as the person being solicited is: 1) a member of the same federal labor organization as defined under section 7103(4) of this title or a federal employee organization which as of the date of enactment of the Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993 had a multicandidate political committee (as defined under section 315(a)(4) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 441a(a)(4))); 2) not a subordinate employee; and 3) the solicitation is for a contribution to the multicandidate political committee (as defined under section 315(a)(4)of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 441a(a)(4))) of such federal labor organization as defined under section 7103(4) of this title or a federal employee organization which as of the date of the enactment of the Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993 had a multicandidate political committee (as defined under section 315(a)(4)of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2) U.S.C. 441a(a)(4))).  However, because of the political activity on duty prohibition (5 U.S.C. 7324(a)), employees may not solicit, accept, or receive these donations while on duty or in the workplace. 

## Permitted Activities for Less Restricted Employees

​ ​Less restricted federal employees may engage in partisan political management and campaigns. Such employees, for example, may:​

- Be candidates for public office in nonpartisan elections
- Register and vote as they choose
- Assist in voter registration drives
- Contribute money to political campaigns, political parties, or partisan political groups
- Attend political fundraising functions
- Attend and be active at political rallies and meetings

- Campaign for or against candidates in partisan elections
- Make campaign speeches for candidates in partisan elections
- Distribute campaign literature in partisan elections
- Volunteer to work on a partisan political campaign
- Express opinions about candidates and issues. If the expression is political activity, however – i.e., activity directed at the success or failure of a political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group – then the expression is not permitted while the employee is on duty, in any federal room or building, while wearing a uniform or official insignia, or using any federally owned or leased vehicle​
