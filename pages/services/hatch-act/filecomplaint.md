OSC is also authorized to investigate violations of the Hatch Act. 5 U.S.C. § 1216 (a)(1)(2). If OSC charges an employee with a violation of the Hatch Act, those charges are adjudicated before the Merit Systems Protection Board. 5 U.S.C. §§ 1215, 1504 – 1508, 7321 – 7326. Filers alleging a violation of the Hatch Act can use OSC's Online Filing Portal by clicking the green _File a Complaint_ button in the top right-hand corner of this screen.

The Online Filing Portal includes a section where filers can indicate that they do not consent to the disclosure of their identity for any purpose. In the alternative, filers have the option to electronically submit a Hatch Act complaint anonymously. However, if such a filer does not provide sufficient information in the complaint, OSC may not be able to fully investigate the alleged Hatch Act violation. In addition, anonymous filers will not receive any information about OSC's investigation, including its outcome. If you would still like to file anonymously, please click [HERE](https://oscportal.powerappsportals.us/haanonymouscase/) to access the webform and file without providing identifying information.

Filers can also complete a Hatch Act complaint form by hand after printing one of the following forms:

- For complaints against federal employees, please fill out the [Federal Hatch Act Complaint Form](../../~assets/documents/federal-hatch-act-complaint-form.pdf)
- For complaints against state, local, or nonprofit employees, please fill out the [State, Local and Nonprofit Complaint Form](../../~assets/documents/state,-local,-and-nonprofit-complaint-form.pdf)​.  ​

Once the appropriate form is completed, it should be mailed to OSC. Please also include any evidence supporting your allegations (for example, documents, newspaper articles, photographs, etc.).

Please be advised that if the form is not filled out completely or the allegations are insufficient, OSC will require the complaint filer to provide additional information before it investigates. Accordingly, be sure to include all of the following information in the complaint:

- ​Name and contact information of person who violated the Hatch Act (“Subject”)
- Agency and position of Subject
- Detailed description of the alleged Hatch Act violation, including names and contact information of potential witnesses and whether, for example, the election at issue is partisan (meaning the candidates are running as political party candidates)

In addition, for allegations involving a state, D.C., or local government employee, include:

- Information about the federal funding the Subject’s employing agency receives
- Description of the duties the Subject performs in connection with federal funds

Complaints should be sent to:

Hatch Act Unit  
U.S. Office of Special Counsel  
1730 M Street, N.W., Suite 218  
Washington, DC 20036-4505  
Fax: (202) 254-3700​  
hatchact@osc.gov

#### Enforcement:

After investigating an alleged Hatch Act violation, OSC may seek disciplinary action against an employee before the Merit Systems Protection Board. When violations are not sufficiently egregious to warrant prosecution, OSC may issue a warning letter to the employee involved.​
