title: When a Dislosure Involves Counterintelligence or Foreign Intelligence Information
---

​​If the disclosure involves counterintelligence or foreign intelligence information that is prohibited from disclosure by law or executive order, the disclosure will be transmitted to the National Security Advisor, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives, and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the U.S. Senate. The referral ends the Special Counsel's involvement with the disclosure and the National Security Advisor and congressional intelligence committees decide how to proceed.
