​A whistleblower's identity will not be revealed by OSC without his or her consent except in rare cases where the Special Counsel determines there is an imminent danger to public health or safety or an imminent violation of a criminal law. In such a case, OSC would attempt to contact the whistleblower to inform him or her of this communication.

While OSC honors an employee's request for anonymity outside OSC, the employee must nevertheless identify him or herself to OSC when filing the disclosure. If OSC receives an anonymous disclosure, OSC will refer it to the Office of Inspector General in the appropriate agency and take no further action on the disclosure.
