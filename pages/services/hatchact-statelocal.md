title: State, D.C., or Local Employee Hatch Act Information
permalink: /serviceshatchact-statelocal/
---

​The Hatch Act restricts the political activity of individuals principally employed by state, District of Columbia, or local executive agencies and who work in connection with programs financed in whole or in part by federal loans or grants. Usually, employment with a state, D.C., or local agency constitutes the principal employment of the employee in question. However, when an employee holds two or more jobs, principal employment is generally deemed to be that job which accounts for the most work time and the most earned income.

## Hatch Act Modernization Act

​On December 19, 2012, Congress passed the Hatch Act Modernization Act of 2012. The Act allows most state and local government employees to run for partisan political office. Prior to this change, state and local government employees were prohibited from running for partisan office if they worked in connection with programs financed in whole or in part by federal loans or grants. With the change, the federal Hatch Act no longer prohibits state and local government employees from running for partisan office unless the employee’s salary is paid for completely by federal loans or grants.​

This change will allow hundreds of thousands of state and local government employees to participate more actively in the democratic process in their communities.

Before entering a race as a candidate, employees should consider the following:

- Is your salary completely funded by federal loans or grants? 

- A very small number of state and local employees may continue to be prohibited from running for office by the federal Hatch Act. Before running for office, take steps to determine that your salary is not entirely -- 100% -- funded by federal loans or grants. Your state, D.C., or local finance office should be able to clarify whether your salary is completely funded by federal loans or grants.

- Does state, D.C., or local law prohibit you from running? 

- ​Nearly every state, many localities, and D.C. have ethics rules that govern the political activity of their employees. This includes, in some cases, the ability of employees to run for state, D.C., or local office. While the rules under the federal Hatch Act have been relaxed with regard to partisan candidacies, states and localities are free to implement more rigid requirements at their discretion. OSC does not keep a comprehensive list of state and local political activity laws, and OSC does not enforce laws passed at the state, D.C., or local level. Your state, D.C., or local ethics office should be able to clarify whether any provision of state, D.C., or local law prohibits you from running for office.

- Do the other Hatch Act prohibitions apply? 

- ​​The Hatch Act Modernization Act did not change the federal Hatch Act’s prohibitions on coercive conduct or misuse of official authority for partisan purposes. A state, D.C., or local employee is still covered by these prohibitions if the employee works in connection with a program financed in whole or in part by federal loans or grants, even if the connection is relatively minor. A covered employee who runs for office would violate the Hatch Act if the employee:

- ​Uses federal or any other public funds to support his own candidacy;
- ​Uses his state, D.C., or local office to support his candidacy, including by using official email, stationery, office supplies, or other equipment or resources; or
- ​Asks subordinates to volunteer for his campaign or contribute to the campaign.
