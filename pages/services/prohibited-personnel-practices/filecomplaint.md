Prohibited personnel practices (PPPs) are employment-related activities that are banned in the federal workforce because they violate the merit system through some form of employment discrimination, retaliation, improper hiring practices, or failure to adhere to laws, rules, or regulations that directly concern the merit system principles.

OSC has the authority to investigate and prosecute violations of the 14 PPPs listed at 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b​). Former and current employees, and applicants for federal employment can file under this section.

Persons wishing to file a PPP complaint can use OSC's Online Filing Portal by clicking the green File a Complaint button in the top right-hand corner of this screen.

The Online Filing Portal includes a series of questions designed to elicit specific information regarding your PPP claim. Please answer each question as completely as possible. The Online Filing Portal also includes a section where filers can indicate whether they consent to the disclosure of their identity for any purpose. Please also attach any evidence supporting your PPP claim (for example, documents, newspaper articles, photographs, etc.) to your online form. Please be advised that if the form is not filled out completely or the allegations are insufficient, OSC may require the filer to provide additional information before it can proceed.

The Online Filing Portal CANNOT be used to submit classified information. If you believe classified information is required to support your claim, please contact the attorney assigned to your case to discuss your options.

OSC strongly encourages the use of the Online Filing Portal, as it improves both efficiency and accuracy. However, if you do not wish to file online, you can complete a PDF form and submit it via mail or email. The link to the PDF is on the File a Complaint information page. ​
