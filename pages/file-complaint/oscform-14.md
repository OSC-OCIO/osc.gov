OSC regulations require that you use an approved complaint form to submit a complaint alleging a prohibited personnel practice or other prohibited activity within OSC's jurisdiction. 

OSC encourages, but does not require, you to use an approved complaint  form to submit a complaint alleging a Hatch Act violation or to submit a disclosure of information alleging agency wrongdoing.

While we encourage you to use the [Online Filing Portal](https://oscportal.powerappsportals.us/) to submit a complaint form to our office. OSC Form 14 can be downloaded, completed then mailed. 

To file a USERRA complaint about discrimination or reemployment as a member  of the uniformed services, please visit the [Department of Labor](https://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/vets/vetpref/1010.htm) to complete a USERRA complaint form. ​
