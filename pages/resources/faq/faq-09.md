## Prohibited Personnel Practices

OSC closed my PPP case alleging whistleblower retaliation. Can I appeal this decision?

Yes. If you alleged whistleblower retaliation in your PPP complaint, you may seek corrective action in an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). Such an appeal is known as an "individual right of action" (IRA). By law, the employee or applicant must first seek corrective action from OSC before filing an IRA. The IRA may be filed:

*   after OSC closes a matter in which retaliation for whistleblowing has been alleged; or
*   120 days after a PPP complaint is filed with OSC, if OSC has not notified the complainant that it will seek corrective action.

The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 expanded the IRA right to include most 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(9) retaliation claims, including:

*   retaliation for filing a whistleblower appeal, complaint, or grievance;
*   retaliation for assisting an individual in the exercise of an appeal, complaint, or grievance right;
*   retaliation for cooperating with or disclosing information to the Inspector General of a federal agency, or the Special Counsel; or
*   retaliation for refusing to obey an order that would require the individual to violate a law.​

Procedures for filing an IRA are set forth in MSPB regulations at [5 C.F.R. Part 1209](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/5/part-1209). Note that, if OSC closed your retaliation case, your IRA appeal must be filed within 65 days of the date of the OSC notice advising you that OSC is closing the case or within 60 days after the ​date you receive the OSC notice, whichever is later. In considering an IRA, the MSPB may refuse to accept any matters that were not specifically presented to OSC first. Similarly, the MSPB will only consider retaliation allegations in an IRA appeal.

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

OSC closed my case and I did not allege retaliation for whistleblowing in my complaint. Can I appeal this decision?

Yes, but only under some circumstances. The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 expanded the IRA right to include most reprisal claims under 2302(b)(9), which is reprisal for engaging in protected activity. If you alleged reprisal f​or engaging in any of the following activities under 2302(b)(9), you may file an IRA with the MSPB (if OSC closed your complaint or has not notified you within 120 days that it will seek corrective action your behalf): 

1.  retaliation for filing a whistleblower appeal, complaint, or grievance;
    
2.  retaliation for assisting an individual in the exercise of an appeal, complaint, or grievance right;
    
3.  retaliation for cooperating with or disclosing information to the Inspector General of an agency, or the Special Counsel; or
    
4.  retaliation for refusing to obey an order that would require the individual to violate a law.
    

If your complaint did not allege reprisal for whistleblowing under (b)(8) or reprisal for protected activity under (b)(9), the law does not allow you to file an IRA with the MSPB. ​

## Prohibited Personnel PracticesFor Federal Agencies and Officials

Can the federal agency have its own representative in an OSC interview?

No. OSC does not permit a federal agency to send a representative to attend OSC interviews, but agency counsel may represent agency employees in limited circumstances. Similarly, an agency cannot require an employee to choose an agency attorney as their personal legal representative. This policy does not prevent an employee from choosing an agency attorney to serve as their legal representative, nor does it require agency counsel to act as their employee's legal representative.  ​​​  

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

What is a federal agency’s responsibility during an OSC investigation?

​​​Federal agencies must provide OSC w​ith timely access to all records and information that relate to OSC's investigation. See 5 U.S.C. § 1212(b)(5)(A). Agencies cannot use a claim of common law privilege, such as attorney-client privilege, to withhold records or information from OSC. See 5 U.S.C. § 1212(b)(5)(C)(i). By providing records and information to OSC, agencies will not be deemed to have waived the privilege against a non-federal entity or individual in any other proceeding. See 5 U.S.C. § 1212(b)(5)(C)(ii).

Federal agencies are also required to make employees available to testify, on official time, and to preserve and provide pertinent records and information to OSC. See 5 C.F.R. § 5.4.

Additionally, federal agencies are prohibited from retaliating against employees who file complaints with OSC or cooperate with an OSC investigation.​

​​​​​  

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

What information can OSC provide to the federal agency about pending PPP complaints?

Very little. If a federal agency liaison has responded to our request for information in a particular case, OSC staff may state whether the PPP complaint is open or closed, but generally does not provide specific information about the matter, including our factual findings, the progress of our investigation, or the reasons for closing our file. In some cases, an agency may propose corrective action before OSC's investigation is finished. Before entering into settlement negotiations with an agency, OSC would obtain the consent of the complainant to pursue a potential resolution of the case.  ​​​

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

I work for the FBI. Can I file with OSC?

OSC has no jurisdiction to hear prohibited personnel practice claims from FBI employees.  FBI employees who allege retaliation for whistleblowing activities must seek a remedy under Department of Justice (DOJ) regulations. Information about filing a complaint with the DOJ Office of Inspector General can be found at [Hotline (justice.gov)](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://oig.justice.gov/hotline&data=05%7c02%7cSKalejaiye%40osc.gov%7c515aca241dc241aa7f5e08dc80ba9a13%7c39dcbe17c0694d7c8ad7efbbedb5fc55%7c1%7c0%7c638526786152336881%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7c0%7c%7c%7c&sdata=ACGbvkVC3O9SIMBGNcKq/jdYnwejqFkHAuMkZTnEd/s%3D&reserved=0 "Original URL: https://oig.justice.gov/hotline.

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

My PPP case is before the MSPB. Can OSC file amicus curiae brief?

​Yes, under certain circumstances. OSC has the authority to formally submit its views on PPP cases pending before the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) in one of two ways: intervention or an amicus curiae (friend of the court) brief.

OSC may choose to intervene in matters it deems highly significant to the proper functioning of the merit system, including cases under the Whistleblower Protection Act. In certain types of cases, OSC must obtain the consent of the person who filed the appeal before intervening. Given our limited resources, OSC cannot intervene on most cases.

An _amicus curiae_ brief is a legal argument provided to a court by a person or group who is not a party to the case, but who could be affected by the legal questions it raises. OSC may submit _amicus curiae_ briefs to comment on legal issues that affect our ability to investigate and prosecute prohibited personnel practices. Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. § 1201.34(e), the MSPB has discretion to accept or reject these submissions.

If you would like OSC to consider a request to intervene or file an _amicus curiae_ brief, send an email to [amicus@osc.gov](mailto:amicus@osc.gov).  Please include:

1.  ​The case name and docket number, if they have been assigned;
2.  Whether you are requesting intervention or an _amicus curiae_ brief;
3.  What, if any, action the MSPB has taken in the matter to date;
4.  Whether any MSPB proceedings are scheduled and, if so, what they are about and when they will be held; and
5.  Why you are seeking OSC's participation, including a description of any novel or important legal issue in the proceeding.

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

How is a disclosure to OSC different from disclosures through other government channels?

*   Federal law guarantees your [confidentiality](services/pages/du-confidentiality.md);  
    
*   The Special Counsel may order the head of the agency involved to investigate and report on your disclosure; and
*   The Special Counsel may send the agency's report, and your comments, to the President and Congress.​​​​​  
    

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

What happens when you make a disclosure?

OSC does not independently investigate whistleblower disclosures. If the Special Counsel finds that the information you disclosed is, or is substantially likely to be, the type of wrongdoing described [here](services/pages/du-process.md), OSC will send the information to​ the head of the agency concerned. OSC will not divulge your identity unless you consent.

The agency head must conduct an investigation and submit a report to the OSC. The Special Counsel then sends the agency report, together with your comments and hers, if any, to the President and the appropriate congressional oversight committees.

​

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

What happens if the Special Counsel finds that the information you disclosed is not, or is not substantially likely to be, the type of wrongdoing that it can refer to an agency?

If the Special Counsel does not send your information to the agency head, OSC sends you a letter explaining why the Special Counsel did not refer the information. This letter will let you know what other disclosure channels may be available to you.​  

At their discretion, the Special Counsel may decide to send the information to the agency head, even if he or she does not find that it is, or is substantially likely to be, the type of wrongdoing described [here​](services/pages/du.md). If he or she does, the agency head is required to inform the Special Counsel in writing of what action has been or is being taken and when such action shall be completed. The Special Counsel will then inform you of the agency's report.  

​  

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

How long does it take?

You will usually hear from an OSC staff member within two weeks of filing your disclosure. The OSC staff member will explain the process and timing to you then.​​  

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

Are all employees, former employees, or applicants for employment in the federal government able to file a disclosure?

No. OSC does not have jurisdiction over disclosures filed by:  

*   Employees of the U.S. Postal Service and the Postal Regulatory Commission;
*   Members of the armed forces of the United States (i.e., non-civilian military employees);
*   State employees operating under federal grants;
*   Other employees or federal agencies exempt by federal law; and
*   Congressional or judicial branch employees

Certain disclosures that involve foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information must be transmitted immediately by the Special Counsel to the National Security Advisor and congressional intelligence committees.​​​​

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesCandidacy ＆ Elections

May I run as an independent candidate in a partisan election?

​Generally, federal employees may not be candidates in partisan elections, even if they run as political independents. Only those federal employees, including further restricted employees, residing in localities specifically designated by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) may run as independents in local elections that are otherwise partisan. OPM’s list of designated localities can be found at 5 C.F.R. § 733.107.​  

Employees who live in a designated locality must ensure that they maintain an independent candidacy when running for local partisan political office in that designated locality.  See OSC’s advisory opinion [here](~assets/documents/Maintaining-an-Independent-Candidacy-When-Running-in-a-Designated-Locality.pdf) for additional information.​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesCandidacy ＆ Elections

I live in a designated locality and I want to run as an independent candidate for State Senate. May I do so?

No.  
The exception allowing federal employees who reside in designated localities to be independent candidates in partisan elections applies only to elections for local offices in the locality where the employee resides. Thus, an employee residing in a designated locality may not be a candidate for state office, if the election is partisan.​​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesCandidacy ＆ Elections

May I keep my elected position if I become a federal employee after taking office?

​Yes. Although the Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from being candidates in partisan elections, it does not prohibit them from holding partisan elective office. Thus, if an individual holds elected office when he becomes employed by the federal government, he may serve out the remainder of his term. Likewise, a federal employee may be appointed to fill a vacancy in a partisan elective office. In both of these situations, however, the federal employee may not seek to retain the position by way of a partisan election.​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesCandidacy ＆ Elections

Can I be appointed to partisan political office?

​Yes. Federal employees may be appointed to a partisan political office. Although the Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from being candidates in partisan ​elections, it does not prohibit them from holding partisan elective office. Thus, the Hatch Act does not prohibit a federal employee from being appointed to a partisan elective office. The federal employee, however, may not seek to retain the position by way of a partisan election without first resigning from federal employment. ​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesCandidacy ＆ Elections

If I run as a candidate for public office in a nonpartisan election, does the Hatch Act allow me to ask for and accept political contributions?

​An employee who is a candidate for public office in a nonpartisan election is not barred by the Hatch Act from soliciting, accepting, or receiving political contributions for his or her own campaign.​

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesCandidacy ＆ Elections

I am a candidate in a nonpartisan election. Can I use my official title in my campaign materials?

Because the election is nonpartisan, the Hatch Act would not prohibit you from using your official title in your campaign materials. However, you should check with your agency ethics official about other rules or regulations that may govern such activity.​​

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesParticipation in Political Party or Campaign Activities

Can I hold party office?

Less Restricted Employees: Yes. While the Hatch Act prohibits a federal employee from being a candidate for public office in a partisan election, the Act does not prohibit an employee from being a candidate for party office. Thus, you may run for and hold office within a political party.

Further Restricted Employees: No. Because a further restricted employee may not take an active part in partisan political management, you may not run for or hold party office.​​​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesParticipation in Political Party or Campaign Activities

Can I attend a state or national party convention? If so, in what capacity?

**Less Restricted Employees:** Yes. A federal employee may serve as a delegate, alternate, or proxy to a state or national party convention.

**Further Restricted Employees:** A _further restricted_ employee may attend a party convention as a spectator, but the employee may not serve as a delegate or proxy, or address the convention, for example, to promote or oppose a candidate.​  

​​​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesParticipation in Political Party or Campaign Activities

Can I put a campaign sign in my front yard?

**Less Restricted Employees:** Yes. A _less restricted_ employee may place in his or her front yard a sign or banner supporting a partisan political candidate.

**Further Restricted Employee:** Yes. A _further restricted_ employee may place in his or her front yard a sign or banner supporting a partisan political candidate.

​​

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesCandidacy ＆ Elections

Can I volunteer for someone’s campaign?

**Less Restricted Employees**: Yes, _less restricted_ employees may volunteer for a partisan candidate's campaign. _Less restricted_ employees are permitted to participate in political activities to the extent not expressly prohibited by the Hatch Act. Examples of permitted activities that constitute political campaigning include: initiating or circulating nominating petitions; canvassing votes in support of or in opposition to a partisan political candidate; endorsing a partisan political candidate; attending and being active at political rallies and meetings; distributing campaign literature; and taking an active part in managing a partisan candidate's political campaign.

_Note:_ _Less restricted_ employees (except certain employees appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate and some employees paid from an appropriation for the Executive Office of the President), however, are prohibited from engaging in political activity while on duty, in a federal room or building, while wearing an official uniform or insignia, or while using a government vehicle. Likewise, _less restricted_ employees may not use their official authority or influence to interfere with the result of an election or solicit, accept, or receive political contributions at any time. Hence, _less restricted_ employees must be mindful that the above-listed activities could violate the Act if the employees engaged in the activities at the wrong time, or in the wrong place or manner. If a _less restricted_ employee has a question about a specific political activity, he or she can contact OSC to obtain further guidance.

**​Further Restricted Employees:** No. The Hatch Act expressly prohibits _further restricted_ employees from taking an active part in partisan political  
management or political campaigns. Accordingly, _further restricted_ employees  
may not campaign for partisan candidates in concert with a political party,  
candidate for partisan political office or a partisan political group. ​​​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesCandidacy ＆ Elections

May I distribute brochures for a political party to people arriving at a polling place on Election Day?

**Less Restricted Employees:** Yes. A _less restricted_ employee may stand outside a polling place on Election Day and hand out brochures on behalf of a partisan political candidate or political party.

**Further Restricted Employees:** No. A _further restricted_ ​employee may not distribute brochures for a political party to people arriving at a polling place on Election Day.

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesCandidacy ＆ Elections

May I run an advertisement in my local newspaper endorsing a candidate for delegate, at the request of the candidate?

**Less Restricted Employees:** Yes. A _less restricted_ employee may endorse or oppose a partisan political candidate or a candidate for political party office in a political advertisement, broadcast, campaign literature, or similar material.

**Further Restricted Employees:** No. The Hatch Act expressly prohibits _further restricted_ employ​ees from taking an active part in partisan political management or political campaigns. Accordingly, _further restricted_ employees may not endorse or oppose a candidate for political party office in a political advertisement, broadcast, campaign literature, or similar material if such endorsement or opposition is done in concert with such a candidate, political party, or partisan political group.​

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesCandidacy ＆ Elections

Does the Hatch Act still apply to me if I take a leave of absence to work on a campaign?

**Less Restricted Employees**: Yes. The Hatch Act applies to federal civilian employees so long as they are employed by an executive branch agency. The only prohibition that is affected by an employee's leave status is [5 U.S.C. § 7324(a)(1)​](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=%28title:5%20section:7324%20edition:prelim%29): an employee may not engage in political activity while they are on duty. Because an employee is not on duty while they are on leave, this prohibition would not apply. However, while on leave, the employee remains subject to the other prohibitions in the Hatch Act. Thus, an employee on leave is still prohibited from engaging in political activity while in a government building, wearing an official uniform or insignia, or using a government vehicle. § 7324. Moreover, while the Act permits _less restricted_ employees to actively participate in partisan political management and partisan political campaigns, those employees are nevertheless prohibited, at all times, from using their official authority or influence for the purpose of affecting the result of an election; knowingly soliciting, accepting, or receiving political contributions from any person; being candidates for public office in partisan elections; and knowingly soliciting or discouraging the political activity of any individual with business before the employee's agency. [§ 7323(a)(1)-(4)​](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/7323).

Thus, while the Hatch Act does not prohibit a _less restricted_ employee from taking leave to volunteer for a partisan political campaign, the employee is still prohibited from, among other things, soliciting, accepting or receiving political contributions while they are on leave.

**Further Restricted Employees:** Yes. The guidelines set forth above, for _less restricted_ employees, apply, but with an added limitation. Unlike _less restricted_ employees, the Hatch Act prohibits _further restricted_ employees from taking an active part in partisan political management and partisan political campaigns. This means _further restricted_ employees may not, at any time, engage in political activity on behalf of or in concert with a political party, partisan political group, or candidate for partisan public office. For instance, taking an "active part" would include: distributing material created by a partisan candidate, political party, or partisan political group; speaking at a political rally organized or sponsored by such entities; or serving as a campaign volunteer. It also would include engaging in political activity through a medium sponsored or controlled by a political party, partisan political group, or partisan candidate, such as by endorsing a candidate in a commercial sponsored by one of these entities.

Thus, the Hatch Act prohibits a _further restricted_ employee from volunteering for a partisan political campaign even if the employee is on leave. ​​​​

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesCandidacy ＆ Elections

Can I serve as a treasurer for a political action committee (PAC) or as the treasurer for someone’s campaign?

**Less Restricted Employees:** It depends. Federal employees may actively participate in partisan political campaigns and partisan political management to the extent not expressly prohibited by the Hatch Act. Thus, an employee may serve as treasurer for a partisan political campaign or other partisan political group, provided he does not solicit, accept, or receive political contributions from any person (or engage in any other of the Act's prohibited activities). For example, an employee serving as the treasurer of a partisan political campaign may not allow his name to appear anywhere on a letter soliciting political contributions for an organization, party, or candidate, including in the letterhead of such a letter. Some states require the campaign treasurer's name to appear on all campaign materials, including solicitations. Thus, an employee living in one of those states would be prohibited from serving as a campaign treasurer. He could, however, hold another position within the campaign if the duties of which would not entail activities prohibited by the Hatch Act.​  

**Further Restricted Employees:** No. _Further restricted_ employees may not take an active part in partisan political management or partisan political campaigns. Thus, they may not hold office in any partisan political organization or work for a partisan political campaign in any capacity. Accordingly, an employee who is _further restricted_ under the Act may not serve as a treasurer for a PAC or for a candidate's partisan political campaign, regardless of whether the position would entail soliciting, accepting, or receiving political contributions.

​​

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesFundraising

Can I make a contribution to the campaign of a partisan candidate, or to a political party or organization?

Yes. A federal employee may contribute to the campaign of a partisan candidate, or to a political party or organization, provided the employee does not do so while on duty or in the federal workspace.

## USERRA

Who does USERRA cover?

USERRA provides civilian employment protections for members and veterans of the “uniformed services”, which includes the Armed Forces (active duty), National Guard or Reserves, and certain other uniformed services such as the National Disaster Medical System, FEMA Urban Search & Rescue, FEMA Reservists, and the Commissioned Corps of both the Public Health Service and NOAA​​  

## USERRA

Who investigates USERRA claims?

The U.S. Department of Labor, Veterans Employment and Training Service (DOL-VETS), investigates USERRA claims against all employers- federal, state, local, and private. Further information can be found under “How to File a USERRA Complaint" [here](services/pages/userra-filecomplaint.md).​

## USERRA

How long does a USERRA claim take?

DOL-VETS has 90 days to complete its investigation of USERRA claims, but may request an extension.​​​

## USERRA

If I am going away on military duty, do I need to give copies of my orders to my employer?

While it is best practice to provide copies of your military orders to your employer **prior** to performing your military duty (if possible), you are not required to do so. You are simply required to provide advance verbal or written notice that the absence is due to military service. However, upon your return, if your military service was for more than 30 days (or if you requested paid military leave for some or all of that service), your employer may request copies of your orders, but cannot delay your reemployment pending receipt of those orders.​​

## USERRA

When I return from military duty, do I have to report back to work right away?

​In order to obtain reemployment protections under USERRA when you return from military duty, you must report for work or request reemployment within a specific time period. Depending on the length of your military duty as follows:  

*   If you were on military duty for less than 30 days, you must report to work on the next regularly scheduled business day or shift that you normally work after time for safe travel plus eight hours' rest.  
    

*   ​​​For example, if an individual works a night shift and their military duty ends at 5:00pm on Monday January 1st, and their next regularly scheduled shift is a night shift at 8:00pm Monday January 1st, that individual would not have to report for that shift, but the next one (8:00pm on Tuesday, January 2nd).

*   ​​If you were on military duty for 31 to 180 days, you have to request reemployment within 14 days of the end of your military duty.
*   If you were on military duty for more than 180 days, you have to request reemployment within 90 days of the end of your military duty.

If an individual does not report within the proper time frame, she may be reemployed, but is subject to discipline by her employer for being absent without leave (AWOL) for the amount of time she exceeded the reporting period.​

​

## USERRA

How should my employer have me listed in their payroll system while I am on military duty?

​Employers should place service members in a leave without pay (LWOP) status while they are on military duty, unless the employee has paid leave that they wish to use for any of that time. Ideally, the LWOP entry should indicate that the employee is out for military service, as distinct from other types of LWOP such as a leave of absence or furlough; many employers designate this type of leave as LWOP-US or LWOP-MIL. Employees should **not** be placed on absent without leave status (AWOL), even pending submission of a copy of their orders.​

## Alternative Dispute Resolution

Why should I consider using OSC's mediation program?

OSC offers voluntary mediation in selected Prohibited Personnel Practice (PPP) cases between federal employee complainants and agencies.  There are several reasons why OSC's mediation program may be beneficial to both employees and agencies:

*   **_Confidentiality_** _–_ Mediation provides employees and agencies with an opportunity to explore and negotiate resolution of the employee's OSC complaint in a confidential setting.
*   **_Retain Control Over Outcome_** _–_ Employees and agencies are the sole decision-makers who determine if they will mediate and whether and how they will resolve the OSC complaint.
*   **_Experienced OSC Mediators_** _–_ Mediators are OSC attorneys who are trained in both mediation and PPP law, enabling them to understand the issues and to assist parties with brainstorming meaningful, creative, and innovative solutions.
*   **_Informal and Flexible Process_** _–_ Mediators collaborate with participants to ensure that the process is tailored to their specific needs.
*   **_Creative and Innovative Solutions_** _–_ Employees and agencies can customize resolution options to meet their specific needs, interests, and objectives.  
*   **_No Cost for Mediation Services_** _–_ There is no charge for OSC mediation services.​  
    

## Alternative Dispute Resolution

Where are mediation sessions held?

Participants can choose to mediate online via Zoom for Government (FedRAMP) or Microsoft Teams (FedRAMP), or in-person at OSC's office in Washington, DC, or another convenient location, if travel funds permit.  ​

## Alternative Dispute Resolution

Who participates in the mediation session?

In addition to OSC mediators, the employee, their attorney (if applicable), and the agency's attorney and settlement official attend the mediation session.  OSC requires the agency settlement official (an agency management official with authority necessary to resolve the dispute) to attend the entire mediation session.  Any individuals who would be investigated by OSC as subjects of the complaint may not serve as the agency settlement official.​

What should I expect if I choose OSC mediation?

If OSC offers mediation, and both the employee and agency agree to participate in mediation, all mediation participants will be asked to sign an Agreement to Mediate, and the pre-mediation process will begin.  During the pre-mediation process, mediators engage in confidential discussions with each party to better understand their perspectives and interests; facilitate information sharing; brainstorm potential options for resolution; and convey initial offers and counteroffers.  Participants are expected to engage actively in the pre-mediation process.  Cases may settle prior to the mediation session as the employee and agency share resolution options.

The initial mediation session is generally scheduled for 2-3 months after the employee and agency agree to mediation.  Throughout the process, mediation remains voluntary; anyone may withdraw at any time.  ​

How often do cases settle in mediation, and what happens if the case does not settle?

At OSC, more than two-thirds of completed mediations result in settlement.  If the employee and agency reach a mutually-agreeable resolution, they will then write and sign a settlement agreement.  If the employee and agency do not reach a settlement, the case will be transferred back to the OSC investigative attorney.  Anything discussed during the mediation process remains confidential.​

Is the program voluntary?

The requirement to inform agency employees of the rights and remedies available to them under the PPP and whistleblower provisions of Title 5 is a statutory obligation. 5 U.S.C. § 2302(d)[​](lists/faqs/editform.md). In late 2017, the President signed two pieces of legislation requiring the head of each agency, in consultation with OSC, and the Inspector General of the agency, to take steps such as providing annual training to supervisors. These steps may be satistfied under OSC's Certification Program.

Are government corporations subject to the Section 2302 requirements and required to complete certification?

Therefore, government corporations are required to certify, but only with respect to the retaliation prohibitions.
