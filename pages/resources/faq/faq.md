## Prohibited Personnel PracticesFiling Complaints

I am a HUD resident. Can I file a PPP complaint at OSC?

​No. OSC does not have jurisdiction over complaints from residents of the Department of Housing and Urban Development regarding their housing situations in HUD facilities. OSC also lacks jurisdiction over complaints of fraud with respect to HUD benefits. If you have such a complaint, we recommend you contact HUD's Office of Inspector General at 1-800-347-3735.​​  

## Prohibited Personnel PracticesFiling Complaints

I work for the Postal Service. Can I file a PPP complaint at OSC?

Maybe. OSC has limited jurisdiction over complaints from U.S. Postal Service employees. OSC can only review complaints from postal service employees that allege unlawful nepotism that allege unlawful nepotism or arbitrary and capricious withholding under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(7); 5 U.S.C. § 1216; 39 U.S.C. § 410(b) . If you believe that a Postal Service employee has hired, advanced, or advocated for the employment of a relative, you can file a complaint at OSC. All other complaints should be directed elsewhere.​​  

## Prohibited Personnel PracticesFiling Complaints

I am a government contractor or employee of a government contractor. Can I file a PPP complaint at OSC?

No. OSC's jurisdiction is limited to complaints from federal employees. OSC does not have jurisdiction over government contractors or employees of government contractors. This is true even for contractors who work directly for federal agencies. Employees of contractors can bring a whistleblower retaliation complaint with the Office of Inspector General at the agency for whom the employee performed work under a government contract. Employee of contractors may also be eligible to file qui tam actions under the False Claims Act. More information about the False Claims Act is available [here​](~assets/documents/C-FRAUDSüA_Primer.pdf). ​​​​​

## Prohibited Personnel PracticesFiling Complaints

I am a uniformed officer of the military. Can I file a PPP complaint at OSC?

No. OSC has no authority to investigate PPP allegations from members of the uniformed service or to petition the Merit Systems Protection Board for disciplinary actions involving military officials (members of the uniformed services), since they are not "employees" who are "appointed in the civil service." See 5 U.S.C. § 2105. As defined in 5 U.S.C. § 2101(3), "uniformed services" means the armed forces, the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service, and the commissioned corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.​​​​

## Prohibited Personnel PracticesFiling Complaints

I am a commissioned officer in the Public Health Service. Can I file a PPP complaint at OSC?

No. Employees of the Public Health Service are considered members of the "uniformed services," as described in the question above. Therefore, although these positions include civilian employment, that civilian employment is predicated upon your uniformed service. However, employees of the Public Health Service can file whistleblower retaliation complaints with the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services.​​  

## Prohibited Personnel PracticesFiling Complaints

I am a non-appropriated fund (NAF) employee. Can I file a PPP complaint at OSC?

No. OSC lacks jurisdiction over employees whose salaries are paid using non-appropriated funds. These include employees of the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, military post exchanges, or other instrumentalities whose purpose is the comfort, pleasure, and contentment of the armed forces.​​​​​

## Prohibited Personnel PracticesFiling Complaints

I believe my veterans’ preference rights were violated. Can I file a PPP complaint at OSC?

Complaints alleging denial of veterans' preference requirements must be filed with the Veterans Employment and Training Service (VETS) at the Department of Labor. There is a 60-day deadline for filing these complaints. The Department of Labor's website explains how to file a [veterans' preference com​plaint​](https://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/vets/vetpref/prefile.htm?complain=Y).  

## Prohibited Personnel PracticesFiling Complaints

Is there a statute of limitations or a deadline for filing a PPP complaint at OSC?

Yes. A person has three years from the time that they knew or should have known of the alleged prohibited personnel practice to file a complaint with OSC.

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

Can you tell me over the phone if I have a good case?

No. We can help you determine whether OSC is an appropriate venue to address the complaint you describe but cannot provide legal advice as to whether you have a meritorious complaint or whether you should pursue other potential avenues, such as filing a grievance or filing an appeal at the Merit Systems Protection Board. A recommendation to consider filing a PPP complaint with OSC should not be viewed as an endorsement of the merits of your complaint. If OSC is not an appropriate venue, we try our best to suggest other options.  ​  ​

## Prohibited Personnel PracticesFiling Complaints

Do I need a lawyer to file a PPP complaint at OSC?

No. Although you are free to hire an attorney if you wish, it is not necessary to have an attorney to file a PPP complaint. OSC’s attorneys have experience dealing with a wide range of complaints and complainants, and make every effort to communicate with you in a way anyone can understand.​​​  

## Prohibited Personnel PracticesFiling Complaints

Can I file a PPP complaint anonymously at OSC?

Yes. Anonymous complaints are acceptable. However, because we cannot contact an anonymous complainant to obtain additional information, such cases pose substantial investigative challenges. If you want to file a PPP complaint anonymously, you are encouraged to provide a detailed description of the nature of your complaint, including, where possible, names and dates. Alternatively, you may want to review the consent options included on form OSC-11, which give complainants the option of selecting from among three levels of confidentiality. This choice may alleviate some of the concerns you have about providing your name in a PPP complaint against your federal agency. ​  

## Prohibited Personnel PracticesFiling Complaints

I have filed an EEO complaint and/or administrative grievance. Can I still file a PPP complaint at OSC?

Maybe. In the majority of cases, you can file a PPP complaint even after you have filed an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) complaint and/or an administrative grievance about the same issues. If your EEO complaint or administrative grievance has reached a federal court, OSC may not be able to pursue your PPP complaint because we would be bound by the court's decision on certain issues.​

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

What is OSC’s policy about PPP complaints of discrimination?

OSC’s treatment of the discrimination complaint will vary depending on the allegation​​​s.​  

Race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age and disability. Discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability is a PPP. 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(1). However, it was not intended that OSC duplicate or bypass the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) process established in both federal agencies and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for redressing discrimination complaints. 5 C.F.R. § 1810.1. Therefore, OSC generally defers discrimination complaints on these bases to the EEO process. At its discretion, however, OSC may investigate discrimination complaints on these bases, particularly where allegations include discrimination as well as other PPPs.

Political affiliation and marital status. Discrimination based on political affiliation or marital status is a PPP. 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(1). Because discrimination complaints on these bases are not within EEOC's jurisdiction, OSC examines such complaints.

Sexual orientation and gender identity. Discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is a PPP. 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(10). As such, OSC examines such complaints. EEOC has stated that discrimination complaints on these bases also may be brought under the [EEO process](http://www.eeoc.gov/federal/directives/lgbt_complaint_processing.cfm).

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

How long does it take for my PPP complaint to be resolved?

OSC makes every effort to resolve PPP complaints expeditiously, but given the variables between cases and the substantial increase in filings in recent years, it is difficult to estimate the length of time  
required to resolve an issue. If a complaint is closed following a preliminary investigation, that process usually takes about 120 days. If a complaint is referred for further investigation, the process can take  
significantly longer. ​​​ ​​  

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

How do I contact the OSC employee assigned to my case?

You can contact your examiner by calling 1-800-872-9855 or 202-804-7000. Please provide your name and complaint number (if known), and our staff will be able to direct you to the examiner assigned to your complaint. Additionally, when you speak to your examiner, you can discuss alternate methods of communicating with them.​​

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

How is a disclosure to OSC different from disclosures through other government channels?

*   Federal law guarantees your [confidentiality](services/pages/du-confidentiality.md);  
    
*   The Special Counsel may order the head of the agency involved to investigate and report on your disclosure; and
*   The Special Counsel may send the agency's report, and your comments, to the President and Congress.​​​​​  
    

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

What happens when you make a disclosure?

OSC does not independently investigate whistleblower disclosures. If the Special Counsel finds that the information you disclosed is, or is substantially likely to be, the type of wrongdoing described [here](services/pages/du-process.md), OSC will send the information to​ the head of the agency concerned. OSC will not divulge your identity unless you consent.

The agency head must conduct an investigation and submit a report to the OSC. The Special Counsel then sends the agency report, together with your comments and hers, if any, to the President and the appropriate congressional oversight committees.

​

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

What happens if the Special Counsel finds that the information you disclosed is not, or is not substantially likely to be, the type of wrongdoing that it can refer to an agency?

If the Special Counsel does not send your information to the agency head, OSC sends you a letter explaining why the Special Counsel did not refer the information. This letter will let you know what other disclosure channels may be available to you.​  

At their discretion, the Special Counsel may decide to send the information to the agency head, even if he or she does not find that it is, or is substantially likely to be, the type of wrongdoing described [here​](services/pages/du.md). If he or she does, the agency head is required to inform the Special Counsel in writing of what action has been or is being taken and when such action shall be completed. The Special Counsel will then inform you of the agency's report.  

​  

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

How long does it take?

You will usually hear from an OSC staff member within two weeks of filing your disclosure. The OSC staff member will explain the process and timing to you then.​​  

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

Are all employees, former employees, or applicants for employment in the federal government able to file a disclosure?

No. OSC does not have jurisdiction over disclosures filed by:  

*   Employees of the U.S. Postal Service and the Postal Regulatory Commission;
*   Members of the armed forces of the United States (i.e., non-civilian military employees);
*   State employees operating under federal grants;
*   Other employees or federal agencies exempt by federal law; and
*   Congressional or judicial branch employees

Certain disclosures that involve foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information must be transmitted immediately by the Special Counsel to the National Security Advisor and congressional intelligence committees.​​​​

## Hatch ActFederal Employees

Is a Hatch Act investigation an administrative or criminal matter?

A Hatch Act investigation is an administrative matter. Hatch Act matters are adjudicated before the Merit Systems Protection Board, which is an administrative agency. However, federal employees also should be aware that certain political activities may also be criminal offenses under title 18 of the U.S. Code. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 210, 211, 594, 595, 600, 601, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607, 610.​​

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesActivity in the Workplace

Can I wear a face mask or other personal protective equipment (PPE) to work if the PPE has a partisan political image or slogan?

No.  Federal employees may not engage in political activity while on duty or in the workplace.  This restriction prohibits employees from wearing partisan political buttons or T-shirts while on duty or in the workplace.  It similarly prohibits employees from wearing face masks, face shields, gloves, or other PPE that feature, for example, a picture of a candidate for partisan political office, a campaign slogan, or the name or logo of a political party.

​ 

  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesCandidacy ＆ Elections

May I serve as a presidential elector?

**Less Restricted Employees:**  The Hatch Act does not prohibit a less restricted employee from serving as a presidential elector.  Presidential electors are selected by a political party to vote in the Electoral College for that party's nominees for president and vice president.  Electors do not have any role in government other than casting their electoral vote.  Thus, electors hold positions within a political party, rather than elected positions within the government, which is permissible for less restricted employees.   

Less restricted employees should be aware that Article II, section 1 of the U.S. Constitution states that “no . . . person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States, shall be appointed an elector."  We recommend that less restricted employees who are interested in serving as electors consult with outside counsel or their state elections office about this constitutional issue.​  
  

**Further Restricted Employees:**  No.  Further restricted employees are prohibited from acting in concert with a political party or candidate for partisan political office.  Because serving as a presidential elector involves accepting a political party's nomination for the position and then voting on behalf of that party in the Electoral College, the Hatch Act prohibits further restricted employees from serving as electors.

What is a partisan political group?

Partisan political groups are defined in the Hatch Act as those groups that (1) are affiliated with a political party or candidate for public office in a partisan election, (2) are organized for a partisan purpose, or (3) engage in partisan political activity.  Under (1), any organization that is recognized by a national or state political party as a club, auxiliary, authorized committee, or other affiliated organization is a partisan political group.  Under (2), any organization formed to support or oppose one or more political parties—or a party's candidates for partisan political office—is a partisan political group.  As for (3), OSC evaluates organizations on a case-by-case basis.  When doing so, OSC considers several factors including, but not limited to, the following:  the organization's stated purpose, as reflected in its bylaws or charter, on its website, and in its other public materials; whether the organization expends its resources on political activity; whether the organization prominently advertises its political activity; the relationship between the organization and its affiliates, if any, that engage in political activity, such as whether they share a website, staff, or office space; and whether the organization has indicated on any government filings that it engages in political activity.​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesParticipation in Political Party or Campaign Activities

Are organizations that are tax-exempt under section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code (501(c)(4) organizations) partisan political groups?

Possibly.  Many 501(c)(4) organizations, or “social welfare organizations," work primarily or exclusively on issue advocacy, in which case OSC would generally not find them to be partisan political groups.  Others, however, engage in some political activity, _i.e._, activity directed toward the success or failure of a political party, partisan political group, or candidate for partisan political office.  In some cases, OSC has found that the amount of political activity a 501(c)(4) organization engages in is so extensive that the organization is a partisan political group for purposes of the Hatch Act.  ​  
  

For example, OSC has previously concluded that when a 501(c)(4) organization and a political action committee operate collectively under a single brand identity, engage in political activity under that shared identity, and also share an executive director, logo, website, and social media accounts, then that 501(c)(4) organization is a partisan political group.  In other cases, OSC might conclude that a 501(c)(4) organization operating independently is a partisan political group if, for example, it spends its resources on political activity, prominently advertises that political activity, and has indicated on government filings that it engages in political activity.  Such determinations are made on a case-by-case basis.​  
  

Even if OSC concludes that a 501(c)(4) organization is not a partisan political group, employees should still be cautious about engaging in any 501(c)(4)-related activity while at work.  This is because some 501(c)(4) organizations that are not partisan political groups may still engage in some political activity, such as by endorsing a candidate for partisan political office.  Because the endorsement meets the Hatch Act's definition of political activity, the Hatch Act would prohibit an employee from, for example, sharing a press release announcing that endorsement while the employee is on duty or in the workplace.   

  

## Hatch ActGeneral

A Hatch Act complaint has been filed against me, can I find out who filed it?

As a general matter, OSC staff may not disclose the name of the person who filed a Hatch Act complaint. OSC’s program files, including Hatch Act complaints, contain personal or sensitive information, which is generally protected from release under the Freedom of Information Act. Release of the names of individuals who have reported suspected Hatch Act violations is generally considered to be an unwarranted invasion of privacy that could interfere with OSC’s law enforcement efforts by subjecting such individuals, on whom OSC relies to report potential violations, to possible harassment or reprisal for doing so. For more information about this policy please refer to  
[1/26/2004 Policy Statement on Disclosure of Information from OSC Program Files (OSC49a)](/Documents/PPP/Policy%20Statements/Policy%20Statement%20on%20Disclosure%20of%20Information%20from%20OSC%20Program%20Files.pdf).​​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesActivity in the Workplace

Can I display a picture of a candidate for partisan political office in my workspace?

Because section 7324 of the Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from engaging in political activity while on duty or in a federal building, the Act generally would prohibit employees from displaying pictures of candidates for partisan public office in the federal workplace. [5 C.F.R. § 734.306​](http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/5/734.306), Example 16. However, we advise that an employee would not be prohibited from having a photograph of a candidate in his office if all of the following apply: the photograph was on display in advance of the election season; the employee is in the photograph with the candidate; and the photograph is a personal one (i.e., the employee has a personal relationship with the candidate and the photograph is taken at some kind of personal event or function, for example, a wedding, and not at a campaign event or some other type of partisan political event). Of course, an employee must not have a political purpose for displaying the photograph, namely, promoting or opposing a political party or a candidate for partisan political office.​​​​​  

​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesActivity in the Workplace

Can I wear a partisan political button or T-shirt while I am at work or display such items in my office?

No. Covered employees may not engage in political activity while on duty, in a government office or building, in uniform, or in a government vehicle. Wearing or displaying candidate, political party, or political group materials while on duty or in your work space qualifies as political activity. This prohibition extends to wearing or displaying such items in, for example, the cafeteria, lobby, or on-site gym of a federal building.​​​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesActivity in the Workplace

Can I have a screen saver on my computer or a picture in my office with a political message (e.g., a campaign sign, campaign logo, etc.)?

No. Covered employees may not engage in political activity while on duty, in a government office or building, in uniform, or in a government vehicle. Displaying campaign material qualifies as political activity.​​​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesActivity in the Workplace

If I have a bumper sticker on my personal car, am I allowed to park the car in a government lot or garage, or in a private lot/garage if the government subsidizes my parking fees?

Yes. An employee is allowed to park his or her privately owned vehicle with a bumper sticker in a government lot or garage. An employee may also park the car with a bumper sticker in a private lot or garage for which the employee receives a subsidy from his or her agency.​​​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesActivity in the Workplace

Will I violate the Hatch Act if I listen to radio programs discussing partisan politics or candidates for partisan political office, or read a book about politics or political candidates while I am in the federal workplace?

No. Some federal agencies allow employees to listen to the radio while they are at work. Merely listening to a radio program that is discussing politics while in the federal workplace, without more, is not a Hatch Act violation. Similarly, merely reading a book about politics or political candidates while in the federal workplace, without more, is not a Hatch Act violation. However, employees should make certain that the federal agency where they work does not have any internal policies prohibiting its employees from generally engaging in any of these activities while at work (i.e., listening to the radio, reading).​​​​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesActivity in the Workplace

Is it a Hatch Act violation for a federal agency to have televisions in the federal workplace that are tuned to stations such as Fox News or MSNBC?

No. Watching, or allowing the broadcast of, stations such as Fox News or MSNBC in the federal workplace, without more, does not violate the Hatch Act. Thus, while some federal agencies may have televisions located in lobbies or other public areas within a federal workplace that are tuned to such stations the Hatch Act does not prohibit them from doing so.​​​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesActivity in the Workplace

If the sitting President is a candidate for reelection, may federal employees display his or her picture in their offices?

An employee covered by the Hatch Act may not engage in political activity while on duty, in a government room or building, while wearing an official uniform, or using a government vehicle. [5 U.S.C. § 7324​](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=%28title:5%20section:7324%20edition:prelim%29). Political activity is defined as activity directed toward the success or failure of a political party, candidate for a partisan political office, or partisan political group. [5 C.F.R. § 734.101​](http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/5/734.101).

Thus, the Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from, among other things, displaying pictures of candidates for partisan public office in the federal workplace. [5 C.F.R. § 734.306​](http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/5/734.306), Example 16. If the President is a candidate for reelection, the Hatch Act prohibits an employee from displaying his or her photograph in the federal workplace, unless one of the two exceptions discussed below applies.

The first exception applies to official photographs of the President. The Hatch Act does not prohibit the continued display of official photographs of the President in the federal workplace, to include both public and employee work spaces. Official photographs include the traditional portrait photo of the President displayed in all federal buildings, as well as photographs of the President conducting official business (e.g., President meeting with heads of state). However, these official photographs must be displayed in a traditional size and manner and should not be altered in any way (e.g., the addition of halos or horns). Pictures that are distributed by the President's campaign or a partisan organization, such as the Democratic National Committee or Organizing for America, are not official, even if they depict the President performing an official act. Similarly, pictures downloaded from the internet or clipped from magazines or newspapers, screen savers, and life-size cutouts are not official photographs for purposes of this exception.

The second exception, which applies to all candidate photographs, concerns personal employee photographs. An employee would not be prohibited from having a photograph of any candidate in his or her office, if all of the following apply: the photograph was on display in advance of the election season; the employee is in the photograph with the candidate; and the photograph is a personal one (i.e., the employee has a personal relationship with the candidate and the photograph is taken at some kind of personal event or function, for example, a wedding, and not at a campaign event or some other type of partisan political event). An employee must not have a political purpose for displaying the photograph, namely, promoting or opposing a political party or a candidate for partisan political office.

If you have any questions, please contact our office for additional guidance.​​​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesActivity in the Workplace

Can a federal employee display in his office a photograph of his spouse or child even if the spouse or child is a candidate in an election for partisan political office?

Yes. The Hatch Act does not prohibit a federal employee from displaying photographs of a spouse or child even if the spouse or child is currently running for partisan political office, provided the photograph is not a campaign photograph.​​

## USERRA

Who does USERRA cover?

USERRA provides civilian employment protections for members and veterans of the “uniformed services”, which includes the Armed Forces (active duty), National Guard or Reserves, and certain other uniformed services such as the National Disaster Medical System, FEMA Urban Search & Rescue, FEMA Reservists, and the Commissioned Corps of both the Public Health Service and NOAA​​  

## USERRA

Who investigates USERRA claims?

The U.S. Department of Labor, Veterans Employment and Training Service (DOL-VETS), investigates USERRA claims against all employers- federal, state, local, and private. Further information can be found under “How to File a USERRA Complaint" [here](services/pages/userra-filecomplaint.md).​

## USERRA

How long does a USERRA claim take?

DOL-VETS has 90 days to complete its investigation of USERRA claims, but may request an extension.​​​

## USERRA

If I am going away on military duty, do I need to give copies of my orders to my employer?

While it is best practice to provide copies of your military orders to your employer **prior** to performing your military duty (if possible), you are not required to do so. You are simply required to provide advance verbal or written notice that the absence is due to military service. However, upon your return, if your military service was for more than 30 days (or if you requested paid military leave for some or all of that service), your employer may request copies of your orders, but cannot delay your reemployment pending receipt of those orders.​​

## USERRA

When I return from military duty, do I have to report back to work right away?

​In order to obtain reemployment protections under USERRA when you return from military duty, you must report for work or request reemployment within a specific time period. Depending on the length of your military duty as follows:  

*   If you were on military duty for less than 30 days, you must report to work on the next regularly scheduled business day or shift that you normally work after time for safe travel plus eight hours' rest.  
    

*   ​​​For example, if an individual works a night shift and their military duty ends at 5:00pm on Monday January 1st, and their next regularly scheduled shift is a night shift at 8:00pm Monday January 1st, that individual would not have to report for that shift, but the next one (8:00pm on Tuesday, January 2nd).

*   ​​If you were on military duty for 31 to 180 days, you have to request reemployment within 14 days of the end of your military duty.
*   If you were on military duty for more than 180 days, you have to request reemployment within 90 days of the end of your military duty.

If an individual does not report within the proper time frame, she may be reemployed, but is subject to discipline by her employer for being absent without leave (AWOL) for the amount of time she exceeded the reporting period.​

​

## USERRA

How should my employer have me listed in their payroll system while I am on military duty?

​Employers should place service members in a leave without pay (LWOP) status while they are on military duty, unless the employee has paid leave that they wish to use for any of that time. Ideally, the LWOP entry should indicate that the employee is out for military service, as distinct from other types of LWOP such as a leave of absence or furlough; many employers designate this type of leave as LWOP-US or LWOP-MIL. Employees should **not** be placed on absent without leave status (AWOL), even pending submission of a copy of their orders.​

## Alternative Dispute Resolution

Why should I consider using OSC's mediation program?

OSC offers voluntary mediation in selected Prohibited Personnel Practice (PPP) cases between federal employee complainants and agencies.  There are several reasons why OSC's mediation program may be beneficial to both employees and agencies:

*   **_Confidentiality_** _–_ Mediation provides employees and agencies with an opportunity to explore and negotiate resolution of the employee's OSC complaint in a confidential setting.
*   **_Retain Control Over Outcome_** _–_ Employees and agencies are the sole decision-makers who determine if they will mediate and whether and how they will resolve the OSC complaint.
*   **_Experienced OSC Mediators_** _–_ Mediators are OSC attorneys who are trained in both mediation and PPP law, enabling them to understand the issues and to assist parties with brainstorming meaningful, creative, and innovative solutions.
*   **_Informal and Flexible Process_** _–_ Mediators collaborate with participants to ensure that the process is tailored to their specific needs.
*   **_Creative and Innovative Solutions_** _–_ Employees and agencies can customize resolution options to meet their specific needs, interests, and objectives.  
*   **_No Cost for Mediation Services_** _–_ There is no charge for OSC mediation services.​  
    

## Alternative Dispute Resolution

Where are mediation sessions held?

Participants can choose to mediate online via Zoom for Government (FedRAMP) or Microsoft Teams (FedRAMP), or in-person at OSC's office in Washington, DC, or another convenient location, if travel funds permit.  ​

## Alternative Dispute Resolution

Who participates in the mediation session?

In addition to OSC mediators, the employee, their attorney (if applicable), and the agency's attorney and settlement official attend the mediation session.  OSC requires the agency settlement official (an agency management official with authority necessary to resolve the dispute) to attend the entire mediation session.  Any individuals who would be investigated by OSC as subjects of the complaint may not serve as the agency settlement official.​  

## Alternative Dispute Resolution

What should I expect if I choose OSC mediation?

If OSC offers mediation, and both the employee and agency agree to participate in mediation, all mediation participants will be asked to sign an Agreement to Mediate, and the pre-mediation process will begin.  During the pre-mediation process, mediators engage in confidential discussions with each party to better understand their perspectives and interests; facilitate information sharing; brainstorm potential options for resolution; and convey initial offers and counteroffers.  Participants are expected to engage actively in the pre-mediation process.  Cases may settle prior to the mediation session as the employee and agency share resolution options.

The initial mediation session is generally scheduled for 2-3 months after the employee and agency agree to mediation.  Throughout the process, mediation remains voluntary; anyone may withdraw at any time.  ​  

## Alternative Dispute Resolution

How often do cases settle in mediation, and what happens if the case does not settle?

At OSC, more than two-thirds of completed mediations result in settlement.  If the employee and agency reach a mutually-agreeable resolution, they will then write and sign a settlement agreement.  If the employee and agency do not reach a settlement, the case will be transferred back to the OSC investigative attorney.  Anything discussed during the mediation process remains confidential.​

## Outreach Training

Is the program voluntary?

The requirement to inform agency employees of the rights and remedies available to them under the PPP and whistleblower provisions of Title 5 is a statutory obligation. 5 U.S.C. § 2302(d)[​](lists/faqs/editform.md). In late 2017, the President signed two pieces of legislation requiring the head of each agency, in consultation with OSC, and the Inspector General of the agency, to take steps such as providing annual training to supervisors. These steps may be satistfied under OSC's Certification Program.  

## Outreach Training

What are the consequences of failing to comply with the statutory obligation?

How do I know if my agency is currently in compliance with OSC’s Certification Program?

OSC maintains lists of [registered agencies​](pages/2302cregistered.md) and [certified agencies​](pages/2302status.md) on this website. Additionally, you may e-mail [certification@osc.gov​](mailto:certification@osc.gov)​ or call (202) 804-7163 to discuss what outreach activities your agency is currently engaged in. You will be informed if your agency is in compliance and what, if any, additional actions your agency will need to take to become certified under OSC’s program.​​​

## Outreach Training

Is the No FEAR Act training sufficient to meet the supervisory training requirement?

In general, the No FEAR Act training will not be sufficient to meet the supervisory training requirement. The supervisory training should cover all 14 of the PPPs. With respect to PPPs, most No FEAR Act training programs only cover retaliation claims.  

## Outreach Training

Are government corporations subject to the Section 2302 requirements and required to complete certification?

​Under 5 U.S.C. § 2302(a)(c)(i), employees of government corporations are covered by the two retaliation prohibitions \[5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(8), (b)(9)\], while most other federal employees are covered by all 14 prohibited personnel practices. Therefore, government corporations are required to certify, but only with respect to the retaliation prohibitions.

## Outreach Training

Once I register for the program, how will I know that my agency is in compliance with OSC’s Certification Program?

If you have registered for the program, after completing the five requirements, you will be asked to submit a certificate of compliance form and documentation. After OSC approves the submission, OSC will grant you a certificate of compliance. Additionally, we list certified agencies on OSC's website and report federal agencies' compliance with OSC's Certification Program annually to Congress.​​​​​​

## Outreach Training

How often will agencies need to be certified as being in compliance with OSC’s Certification Program?

Agencies need to complete a checklist (coming soon) each year and submit a compliance form every three years.​​

## Outreach Training

How often does an agency need to train supervisors on PPPs and the Whistleblower Protection Act/Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (WPA/WPEA)?

In consultation with OSC, agencies need to train supervisors every three years on PPPs and whistleblower disclosures and each year on how to respond to complaints alleging a violation of whistleblower protections.​  

## Outreach Training

How often do employees need to be notified of their rights and remedies under the WPA/WPEA?

Employees must be notified annually.​​  

## Outreach Training

Will this program generate frivolous complaints?

Our experience is that agency-wide education programs have not resulted in a substantial increase in the number of complaints filed by employees of that agency, and often, such training helps prevent PPPs from occurring.​

## Outreach Training

If an agency has employees that are not covered by all Title 5 provisions, will they need to certify under OSC’s program?

Some agencies have federal employees who are only covered by a limited number of Title 5 provisions. If any provisions of the WPA/WPEA cover these employees, the agency is responsible for informing the employees of their rights and responsibilities under the statute, and certifying under the relevant provisions of OSC’s program.​  

## Outreach Training

What is 2302(c) certification?

OSC's 2302(c) Certification Program allows federal agencies to meet the statutory obligation to inform their workforces about the rights and remedies available to them under the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA), the Whistleblower Protection and Enhancement Act (WPEA), and related civil service laws. 5 U.S.C. § 2302(c). It also allows agencies to meet the requirements of the second Open Government National Action Plan. Under the 2302(c) Certification Program, OSC will certify an agency's compliance if the agency meets the following five requirements:

1.  Placing informational posters at agency facilities;
2.  Providing information to ​​new employees about the WPA/WPEA (including the 13 PPPs) as part of the orientation process;
3.  Providing information to current employees on an annual basis about the WPA/WPEA;
4.  Training supervisors every three years on the WPA/WPEA; and
5.  Displaying a link to OSC's website on the agency's website or intranet.

## Outreach Training

Does OSC offer training?

Yes. OSC offers training to federal agencies and non-federal organizations in each of the areas within OSC's jurisdiction. Specifically, OSC offers training on (1) PPPs, including retaliation for whistleblowing; (2) whistleblower disclosures filed with OSC's Disclosure Unit; (3) the Hatch Act and its application both to federal employees and to state and local employees; and (4) the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). Additionally, OSC publishes a variety of materials on PPPs, whistleblower disclosures, and the Hatch Act. These publications can be printed from this website.​​​
