## Prohibited Personnel Practices

OSC closed my PPP case alleging whistleblower retaliation. Can I appeal this decision?

Yes. If you alleged whistleblower retaliation in your PPP complaint, you may seek corrective action in an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). Such an appeal is known as an "individual right of action" (IRA). By law, the employee or applicant must first seek corrective action from OSC before filing an IRA. The IRA may be filed:

*   after OSC closes a matter in which retaliation for whistleblowing has been alleged; or
*   120 days after a PPP complaint is filed with OSC, if OSC has not notified the complainant that it will seek corrective action.

The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 expanded the IRA right to include most 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(9) retaliation claims, including:

*   retaliation for filing a whistleblower appeal, complaint, or grievance;
*   retaliation for assisting an individual in the exercise of an appeal, complaint, or grievance right;
*   retaliation for cooperating with or disclosing information to the Inspector General of a federal agency, or the Special Counsel; or
*   retaliation for refusing to obey an order that would require the individual to violate a law.​

Procedures for filing an IRA are set forth in MSPB regulations at [5 C.F.R. Part 1209](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/5/part-1209). Note that, if OSC closed your retaliation case, your IRA appeal must be filed within 65 days of the date of the OSC notice advising you that OSC is closing the case or within 60 days after the ​date you receive the OSC notice, whichever is later. In considering an IRA, the MSPB may refuse to accept any matters that were not specifically presented to OSC first. Similarly, the MSPB will only consider retaliation allegations in an IRA appeal.

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

OSC closed my case and I did not allege retaliation for whistleblowing in my complaint. Can I appeal this decision?

Yes, but only under some circumstances. The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 expanded the IRA right to include most reprisal claims under 2302(b)(9), which is reprisal for engaging in protected activity. If you alleged reprisal f​or engaging in any of the following activities under 2302(b)(9), you may file an IRA with the MSPB (if OSC closed your complaint or has not notified you within 120 days that it will seek corrective action your behalf): 

1.  retaliation for filing a whistleblower appeal, complaint, or grievance;
    
2.  retaliation for assisting an individual in the exercise of an appeal, complaint, or grievance right;
    
3.  retaliation for cooperating with or disclosing information to the Inspector General of an agency, or the Special Counsel; or
    
4.  retaliation for refusing to obey an order that would require the individual to violate a law.
    

If your complaint did not allege reprisal for whistleblowing under (b)(8) or reprisal for protected activity under (b)(9), the law does not allow you to file an IRA with the MSPB. ​

## Prohibited Personnel PracticesFor Federal Agencies and Officials

Can the federal agency have its own representative in an OSC interview?

No. OSC does not permit a federal agency to send a representative to attend OSC interviews, but agency counsel may represent agency employees in limited circumstances. Similarly, an agency cannot require an employee to choose an agency attorney as their personal legal representative. This policy does not prevent an employee from choosing an agency attorney to serve as their legal representative, nor does it require agency counsel to act as their employee's legal representative.  ​​​  

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

What is a federal agency’s responsibility during an OSC investigation?

​​​Federal agencies must provide OSC w​ith timely access to all records and information that relate to OSC's investigation. See 5 U.S.C. § 1212(b)(5)(A). Agencies cannot use a claim of common law privilege, such as attorney-client privilege, to withhold records or information from OSC. See 5 U.S.C. § 1212(b)(5)(C)(i). By providing records and information to OSC, agencies will not be deemed to have waived the privilege against a non-federal entity or individual in any other proceeding. See 5 U.S.C. § 1212(b)(5)(C)(ii).

Federal agencies are also required to make employees available to testify, on official time, and to preserve and provide pertinent records and information to OSC. See 5 C.F.R. § 5.4.

Additionally, federal agencies are prohibited from retaliating against employees who file complaints with OSC or cooperate with an OSC investigation.​

​​​​​  

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

What information can OSC provide to the federal agency about pending PPP complaints?

Very little. If a federal agency liaison has responded to our request for information in a particular case, OSC staff may state whether the PPP complaint is open or closed, but generally does not provide specific information about the matter, including our factual findings, the progress of our investigation, or the reasons for closing our file. In some cases, an agency may propose corrective action before OSC's investigation is finished. Before entering into settlement negotiations with an agency, OSC would obtain the consent of the complainant to pursue a potential resolution of the case.  ​​​

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

I work for the FBI. Can I file with OSC?

OSC has no jurisdiction to hear prohibited personnel practice claims from FBI employees.  FBI employees who allege retaliation for whistleblowing activities must seek a remedy under Department of Justice (DOJ) regulations. Information about filing a complaint with the DOJ Office of Inspector General can be found at [Hotline (justice.gov)](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://oig.justice.gov/hotline&data=05%7c02%7cSKalejaiye%40osc.gov%7c515aca241dc241aa7f5e08dc80ba9a13%7c39dcbe17c0694d7c8ad7efbbedb5fc55%7c1%7c0%7c638526786152336881%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7c0%7c%7c%7c&sdata=ACGbvkVC3O9SIMBGNcKq/jdYnwejqFkHAuMkZTnEd/s%3D&reserved=0 "Original URL: https://oig.justice.gov/hotline.

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

My PPP case is before the MSPB. Can OSC file amicus curiae brief?

​Yes, under certain circumstances. OSC has the authority to formally submit its views on PPP cases pending before the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) in one of two ways: intervention or an amicus curiae (friend of the court) brief.

OSC may choose to intervene in matters it deems highly significant to the proper functioning of the merit system, including cases under the Whistleblower Protection Act. In certain types of cases, OSC must obtain the consent of the person who filed the appeal before intervening. Given our limited resources, OSC cannot intervene on most cases.

An _amicus curiae_ brief is a legal argument provided to a court by a person or group who is not a party to the case, but who could be affected by the legal questions it raises. OSC may submit _amicus curiae_ briefs to comment on legal issues that affect our ability to investigate and prosecute prohibited personnel practices. Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. § 1201.34(e), the MSPB has discretion to accept or reject these submissions.

If you would like OSC to consider a request to intervene or file an _amicus curiae_ brief, send an email to [amicus@osc.gov](mailto:amicus@osc.gov).  Please include:

1.  ​The case name and docket number, if they have been assigned;
2.  Whether you are requesting intervention or an _amicus curiae_ brief;
3.  What, if any, action the MSPB has taken in the matter to date;
4.  Whether any MSPB proceedings are scheduled and, if so, what they are about and when they will be held; and
5.  Why you are seeking OSC's participation, including a description of any novel or important legal issue in the proceeding.

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

How is a disclosure to OSC different from disclosures through other government channels?

*   Federal law guarantees your [confidentiality](services/pages/du-confidentiality.md);  
    
*   The Special Counsel may order the head of the agency involved to investigate and report on your disclosure; and
*   The Special Counsel may send the agency's report, and your comments, to the President and Congress.​​​​​  
    

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

What happens when you make a disclosure?

OSC does not independently investigate whistleblower disclosures. If the Special Counsel finds that the information you disclosed is, or is substantially likely to be, the type of wrongdoing described [here](services/pages/du-process.md), OSC will send the information to​ the head of the agency concerned. OSC will not divulge your identity unless you consent.

The agency head must conduct an investigation and submit a report to the OSC. The Special Counsel then sends the agency report, together with your comments and hers, if any, to the President and the appropriate congressional oversight committees.

​

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

What happens if the Special Counsel finds that the information you disclosed is not, or is not substantially likely to be, the type of wrongdoing that it can refer to an agency?

If the Special Counsel does not send your information to the agency head, OSC sends you a letter explaining why the Special Counsel did not refer the information. This letter will let you know what other disclosure channels may be available to you.​  

At their discretion, the Special Counsel may decide to send the information to the agency head, even if he or she does not find that it is, or is substantially likely to be, the type of wrongdoing described [here​](services/pages/du.md). If he or she does, the agency head is required to inform the Special Counsel in writing of what action has been or is being taken and when such action shall be completed. The Special Counsel will then inform you of the agency's report.  

​  

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

How long does it take?

You will usually hear from an OSC staff member within two weeks of filing your disclosure. The OSC staff member will explain the process and timing to you then.​​  

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

Are all employees, former employees, or applicants for employment in the federal government able to file a disclosure?

No. OSC does not have jurisdiction over disclosures filed by:  

*   Employees of the U.S. Postal Service and the Postal Regulatory Commission;
*   Members of the armed forces of the United States (i.e., non-civilian military employees);
*   State employees operating under federal grants;
*   Other employees or federal agencies exempt by federal law; and
*   Congressional or judicial branch employees

Certain disclosures that involve foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information must be transmitted immediately by the Special Counsel to the National Security Advisor and congressional intelligence committees.​​​​

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesPresidential Appointees with Senate Confirmation General

I am an employee who was appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate (PAS). Am I covered by the Hatch Act?

Yes. An employee appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate (PAS), is subject to the provisions of the Hatch Act. However, certain PAS's are not subject to the Act's prohibition against engaging in political activity while on duty, in a federal room or building, wearing an official uniform or insignia, or using a government vehicle. To be exempt from this prohibition, a PAS must meet all of the following criteria:   

> 1) the duties and responsibilities of his position must continue outside normal duty hours and while away from the normal duty post; 
> 
> 2) his position must be located within the United States; and   
> 
> 3) he must determine policies to be pursued by the United States in relations with foreign powers or in the nationwide administration of federal laws. ​

If a PAS meets all these criteria, he is not prohibited from engaging in political activity while on duty, in a federal room or building, wearing an official uniform or insignia, or using a government vehicle, provided the costs associated with the political activity are not paid for by money derived from the Treasury of the United States. However, the PAS remains subject to all the other prohibitions of the Hatch Act, and thus, may not: use his official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election; knowingly solicit, accept, or receive a political contribution from any person; be a candidate for public office in a partisan election; or knowingly solicit or discourage the political activity of any person who has business before the employee's employing office.​​​

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesPresidential Appointees with Senate Confirmation General

I am an employee who was appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Does the exemption from the Hatch Act’s prohibition against engaging in political activity while on duty, which applies to me, also apply to my staff?

No.  

Assuming a Presidential appointee with Senate confirmation (PAS) meets the criteria outlined in the answer to the previous question, he—but only he—may engage in political activity while on duty, in a  ​government room or building, wearing an official uniform or insignia, or using a government vehicle, so long as, the costs associated with the political activity are not paid for by money derived from the Treasury of the United States. The appointee’s staff, however, is not subject to this exemption. Therefore, the appointee’s staff members are still prohibited from engaging in political activity while on duty, in a federal room or building, wearing an official uniform or insignia, or using a government vehicle.​​

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesPresidential Appointees with Senate Confirmation General

May a Presidential appointee with Senate confirmation (PAS) ask a subordinate schedule C or non-career senior executive service appointee (or any other subordinate employee) to write a policy speech for the PAS to give at a partisan political event?

No. The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees, including PAS’s, from soliciting or accepting uncompensated volunteer services from an individual who is a subordinate. [5 C.F.R. §§ 734.302(b)(3)​](http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/5/734.302), [734.303(d).](http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/5/734.303) Thus, the Act prohibits a supervisor from soliciting a subordinate employee to write a policy speech for the supervisor to give at a partisan political event. In addition, the Act prohibits a supervisor from accepting such a speech from a subordinate. The fact that the policy speech contains no partisan political advocacy is irrelevant. ​​​

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesPresidential Appointees with Senate Confirmation General

May a Presidential appointee with Senate confirmation (PAS), ask his chief of staff (or any other subordinate employee) to contact and/or liaise with a political party to find out where, or if, the party needs the PAS’s help?

No. The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees, including PAS’s, from soliciting or accepting uncompensated volunteer services for any political purpose from an individual who is a subordinate. [5 C.F.R. §§ 734.302(b)(3)​](http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/5/734.302), [734.303(d)​](http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/5/734.303)​. Thus, the Act prohibits a supervisor from asking subordinate employees to contact a political party to inquire about opportunities for the PAS to assist the party.​​​

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesPresidential Appointees with Senate Confirmation General

May a Presidential appointee with Senate confirmation (PAS) ask his executive assistant (or any other subordinate employee) to attend a political party meeting that the PAS is scheduled to attend but is now unable to do so?

No. The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees, including PAS’s, from soliciting or accepting uncompensated volunteer services for any political purpose from an individual who is a subordinate. 5 C.F.R. §§ 734.302(b)(3), 734.303(d). Thus, the Act prohibits a supervisor from asking subordinate employees to attend a political party meeting or any other partisan political event.​​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesPresidential Appointees with Senate Confirmation General

When engaging in political activity (i.e., activity directed at the success or failure of a political party, partisan political candidate, or partisan political group), such as speaking at campaign events, may a Cabinet secretary use the title “Secretary?

No. Hatch Act regulation states that an employee may not use his or her official title while participating in political activity. [5 C.F.R. § 734.302(b)(1)](http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/5/734.302). Accordingly, a Cabinet secretary may not use the official title “Secretary” when engaging in political activity, such as speaking at a political campaign event. However, a Cabinet secretary may use a general form of address, such as “The Honorable,” when engaging in political activity, as such address does not identify his or her position. [5 C.F.R. § 734.302​](http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/5/734.302), Example 1.​​

## Hatch ActState, Local, and Nonprofit EmployeesWho is Covered?

Can a state, D.C., or local employee be covered by the Hatch Act even if his/her salary is not federally funded?

Yes, on questions of coercio​n or use of official authority (but not on the candidacy prohibition).  

The Merit Systems Protection Board has held that the test of whether an employee is covered by the Hatch Act is whether, as a normal and foreseeable incident of his principal employment, the employee performs duties in connection with an activity financed in whole or in part by federal funds. Special Counsel v. Gallagher, 44 M.S.P.R. 57, 61 (1990). If an employee meets this standard, the source of the employee’s salary is irrelevant. See Special Counsel v. Williams, 56 M.S.P.R. 277, 283-84 (1993), aff’d, Williams v. M.S.P.B., 55 F.3d 917 (4th Cir. 1995).​​

## Hatch ActState, Local, and Nonprofit EmployeesWho is Covered?

I do not apply for or administer any federal grants or loans at my agency, and I have no authority or discretion over the federal funding my agency receives, does that mean I am not subject to the Hatch Act?

Not necessarily. An officer or employee of a state, D.C., or local agency is subject to the Hatch Act if, as a normal and foreseeable incident of his principal position or job, he performs duties in connection with an activity financed in whole or in part by federal funds. Coverage is not dependent on whether the employee actually administers the funds or has policy duties with respect to them. However, an employee may have other duties in connection with federally funded programs or activities, and thus may be covered by the Hatch Act, even though he does not apply for or administer federal loans or grants or have any  
authority or discretion over the federal funding.​​  

## Hatch ActState, Local, and Nonprofit EmployeesWho is Covered?

If an agency receives federal grants or loans, are all employees of that agency covered by the Hatch Act?

No, not necessarily. If an agency receives federal grants or loans, only those employees of the agency who, as a normal and foreseeable incident of their employment, perform duties in connection with activities financed in whole or in part by the federal grants or loans are subject to the Act.​​  

## Hatch ActState, Local, and Nonprofit EmployeesWho is Covered?

What is the education exemption and which employees fall within it?

The Hatch Act exempts from coverage individuals who are principally employed by educational or research institutions, establishments, agencies or systems that are supported in whole or in part by a state or political subdivision thereof, or the D.C. All employees of these entities fall within the exemption (e.g., teacher, administrator, custodian, etc.).​​​

## Hatch ActState, Local, and Nonprofit EmployeesWho is Covered?

I work for a nonprofit organization, am I covered by the Hatch Act?

Maybe. The Hatch Act applies to employees of private, nonprofit organizations only if the statutes through which these organizations derive their federal funding contain a provision stating that the recipient organizations are deemed to be state, D.C. or local government agencies for purposes of the Hatch Act. To date, the statutes authorizing Head Start and Community Service Block Grant (CSBG)  
are the only statutes that contain such a provision. Accordingly, covered employees are those individuals at private nonprofit organizations who perform duties “in connection with” programs financed in whole or in part by Head Start or CSBG funds.​​​​​

## Hatch ActState, Local, and Nonprofit EmployeesCandidacy ＆ Elections

If I am covered by the Hatch Act, will taking a sabbatical or leave of absence allow me to be a candidate in a partisan election?

No. If you are covered by the Hatch Act, taking a sabbatical or leave of absence will not allow you to be a candidate in a partisan election. State, local employees, and D.C. employees subject to the Hatch Act continue to be covered while on annual leave, sick leave, administrative leave, furlough, or any other paid or unpaid leave.​​

## Hatch ActState, Local, and Nonprofit EmployeesCandidacy ＆ Elections

What is a partisan election?

The Hatch Act defines partisan as referring to a political party. [5 C.F.R. §151.101(h)​](http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/5/151.101). Thus, under the Hatch Act, an election for public office is a partisan election if any candidate is running as a representative of, for instance, the Republican or Democratic Party. An employee whose salary is entirely federally funded may not be a cand​idate for public office in a partisan election. [5 U.S.C. §1502(a)(3)​](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/1502).​​​​

## Hatch ActState, Local, and Nonprofit EmployeesCandidacy ＆ Elections

My local community is holding a special election to fill a vacancy for an elected office, does the Hatch Act apply to the special election?

Yes. If the special election is partisan and your salary is entirely federally funded, you would be prohibited from being a candidate in such an election. ​​​

## Hatch ActState, Local, and Nonprofit EmployeesCandidacy ＆ Elections

I am covered by the Hatch Act restrictions on candidacy and I am running for office in a jurisdiction other than where I work. Is this still a violation of the Hatch Act?

Yes. The Hatch Act's prohibitions on state, D.C., and local employees are applicable regardless of jurisdiction, or local population.​

## USERRA

Who does USERRA cover?

USERRA provides civilian employment protections for members and veterans of the “uniformed services”, which includes the Armed Forces (active duty), National Guard or Reserves, and certain other uniformed services such as the National Disaster Medical System, FEMA Urban Search & Rescue, FEMA Reservists, and the Commissioned Corps of both the Public Health Service and NOAA​​  

## USERRA

Who investigates USERRA claims?

The U.S. Department of Labor, Veterans Employment and Training Service (DOL-VETS), investigates USERRA claims against all employers- federal, state, local, and private. Further information can be found under “How to File a USERRA Complaint" [here](services/pages/userra-filecomplaint.md).​

## USERRA

How long does a USERRA claim take?

DOL-VETS has 90 days to complete its investigation of USERRA claims, but may request an extension.​​​

## USERRA

If I am going away on military duty, do I need to give copies of my orders to my employer?

While it is best practice to provide copies of your military orders to your employer **prior** to performing your military duty (if possible), you are not required to do so. You are simply required to provide advance verbal or written notice that the absence is due to military service. However, upon your return, if your military service was for more than 30 days (or if you requested paid military leave for some or all of that service), your employer may request copies of your orders, but cannot delay your reemployment pending receipt of those orders.​​

## USERRA

When I return from military duty, do I have to report back to work right away?

​In order to obtain reemployment protections under USERRA when you return from military duty, you must report for work or request reemployment within a specific time period. Depending on the length of your military duty as follows:  

*   If you were on military duty for less than 30 days, you must report to work on the next regularly scheduled business day or shift that you normally work after time for safe travel plus eight hours' rest.  
    

*   ​​​For example, if an individual works a night shift and their military duty ends at 5:00pm on Monday January 1st, and their next regularly scheduled shift is a night shift at 8:00pm Monday January 1st, that individual would not have to report for that shift, but the next one (8:00pm on Tuesday, January 2nd).

*   ​​If you were on military duty for 31 to 180 days, you have to request reemployment within 14 days of the end of your military duty.
*   If you were on military duty for more than 180 days, you have to request reemployment within 90 days of the end of your military duty.

If an individual does not report within the proper time frame, she may be reemployed, but is subject to discipline by her employer for being absent without leave (AWOL) for the amount of time she exceeded the reporting period.​

​

## USERRA

How should my employer have me listed in their payroll system while I am on military duty?

​Employers should place service members in a leave without pay (LWOP) status while they are on military duty, unless the employee has paid leave that they wish to use for any of that time. Ideally, the LWOP entry should indicate that the employee is out for military service, as distinct from other types of LWOP such as a leave of absence or furlough; many employers designate this type of leave as LWOP-US or LWOP-MIL. Employees should **not** be placed on absent without leave status (AWOL), even pending submission of a copy of their orders.​

## Alternative Dispute Resolution

Why should I consider using OSC's mediation program?

OSC offers voluntary mediation in selected Prohibited Personnel Practice (PPP) cases between federal employee complainants and agencies.  There are several reasons why OSC's mediation program may be beneficial to both employees and agencies:

*   **_Confidentiality_** _–_ Mediation provides employees and agencies with an opportunity to explore and negotiate resolution of the employee's OSC complaint in a confidential setting.
*   **_Retain Control Over Outcome_** _–_ Employees and agencies are the sole decision-makers who determine if they will mediate and whether and how they will resolve the OSC complaint.
*   **_Experienced OSC Mediators_** _–_ Mediators are OSC attorneys who are trained in both mediation and PPP law, enabling them to understand the issues and to assist parties with brainstorming meaningful, creative, and innovative solutions.
*   **_Informal and Flexible Process_** _–_ Mediators collaborate with participants to ensure that the process is tailored to their specific needs.
*   **_Creative and Innovative Solutions_** _–_ Employees and agencies can customize resolution options to meet their specific needs, interests, and objectives.  
*   **_No Cost for Mediation Services_** _–_ There is no charge for OSC mediation services.​  
    

## Alternative Dispute Resolution

In addition to OSC mediators, the employee, their attorney (if applicable), and the agency's attorney and settlement official attend the mediation session.  OSC requires the agency settlement official (an agency management official with authority necessary to resolve the dispute) to attend the entire mediation session.  Any individuals who would be investigated by OSC as subjects of the complaint may not serve as the agency settlement official.​

What should I expect if I choose OSC mediation?

If OSC offers mediation, and both the employee and agency agree to participate in mediation, all mediation participants will be asked to sign an Agreement to Mediate, and the pre-mediation process will begin.  During the pre-mediation process, mediators engage in confidential discussions with each party to better understand their perspectives and interests; facilitate information sharing; brainstorm potential options for resolution; and convey initial offers and counteroffers.  Participants are expected to engage actively in the pre-mediation process.  Cases may settle prior to the mediation session as the employee and agency share resolution options.

The initial mediation session is generally scheduled for 2-3 months after the employee and agency agree to mediation.  Throughout the process, mediation remains voluntary; anyone may withdraw at any time.  ​  

## Alternative Dispute Resolution

How often do cases settle in mediation, and what happens if the case does not settle?

At OSC, more than two-thirds of completed mediations result in settlement.  If the employee and agency reach a mutually-agreeable resolution, they will then write and sign a settlement agreement.  If the employee and agency do not reach a settlement, the case will be transferred back to the OSC investigative attorney.  Anything discussed during the mediation process remains confidential.​

Is the program voluntary?

The requirement to inform agency employees of the rights and remedies available to them under the PPP and whistleblower provisions of Title 5 is a statutory obligation. 5 U.S.C. § 2302(d)[​](lists/faqs/editform.md). In late 2017, the President signed two pieces of legislation requiring the head of each agency, in consultation with OSC, and the Inspector General of the agency, to take steps such as providing annual training to supervisors. These steps may be satistfied under OSC's Certification Program.
