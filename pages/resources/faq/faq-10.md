## Prohibited Personnel Practices

OSC closed my PPP case alleging whistleblower retaliation. Can I appeal this decision?

Yes. If you alleged whistleblower retaliation in your PPP complaint, you may seek corrective action in an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). Such an appeal is known as an "individual right of action" (IRA). By law, the employee or applicant must first seek corrective action from OSC before filing an IRA. The IRA may be filed:

*   after OSC closes a matter in which retaliation for whistleblowing has been alleged; or
*   120 days after a PPP complaint is filed with OSC, if OSC has not notified the complainant that it will seek corrective action.

The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 expanded the IRA right to include most 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(9) retaliation claims, including:

*   retaliation for filing a whistleblower appeal, complaint, or grievance;
*   retaliation for assisting an individual in the exercise of an appeal, complaint, or grievance right;
*   retaliation for cooperating with or disclosing information to the Inspector General of a federal agency, or the Special Counsel; or
*   retaliation for refusing to obey an order that would require the individual to violate a law.​

Procedures for filing an IRA are set forth in MSPB regulations at [5 C.F.R. Part 1209](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/5/part-1209). Note that, if OSC closed your retaliation case, your IRA appeal must be filed within 65 days of the date of the OSC notice advising you that OSC is closing the case or within 60 days after the ​date you receive the OSC notice, whichever is later. In considering an IRA, the MSPB may refuse to accept any matters that were not specifically presented to OSC first. Similarly, the MSPB will only consider retaliation allegations in an IRA appeal.

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

OSC closed my case and I did not allege retaliation for whistleblowing in my complaint. Can I appeal this decision?

Yes, but only under some circumstances. The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 expanded the IRA right to include most reprisal claims under 2302(b)(9), which is reprisal for engaging in protected activity. If you alleged reprisal f​or engaging in any of the following activities under 2302(b)(9), you may file an IRA with the MSPB (if OSC closed your complaint or has not notified you within 120 days that it will seek corrective action your behalf): 

1.  retaliation for filing a whistleblower appeal, complaint, or grievance;
    
2.  retaliation for assisting an individual in the exercise of an appeal, complaint, or grievance right;
    
3.  retaliation for cooperating with or disclosing information to the Inspector General of an agency, or the Special Counsel; or
    
4.  retaliation for refusing to obey an order that would require the individual to violate a law.
    

If your complaint did not allege reprisal for whistleblowing under (b)(8) or reprisal for protected activity under (b)(9), the law does not allow you to file an IRA with the MSPB. ​

## Prohibited Personnel PracticesFor Federal Agencies and Officials

Can the federal agency have its own representative in an OSC interview?

No. OSC does not permit a federal agency to send a representative to attend OSC interviews, but agency counsel may represent agency employees in limited circumstances. Similarly, an agency cannot require an employee to choose an agency attorney as their personal legal representative. This policy does not prevent an employee from choosing an agency attorney to serve as their legal representative, nor does it require agency counsel to act as their employee's legal representative.  ​​​  

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

What is a federal agency’s responsibility during an OSC investigation?

​​​Federal agencies must provide OSC w​ith timely access to all records and information that relate to OSC's investigation. See 5 U.S.C. § 1212(b)(5)(A). Agencies cannot use a claim of common law privilege, such as attorney-client privilege, to withhold records or information from OSC. See 5 U.S.C. § 1212(b)(5)(C)(i). By providing records and information to OSC, agencies will not be deemed to have waived the privilege against a non-federal entity or individual in any other proceeding. See 5 U.S.C. § 1212(b)(5)(C)(ii).

Federal agencies are also required to make employees available to testify, on official time, and to preserve and provide pertinent records and information to OSC. See 5 C.F.R. § 5.4.

Additionally, federal agencies are prohibited from retaliating against employees who file complaints with OSC or cooperate with an OSC investigation.​

​​​​​  

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

What information can OSC provide to the federal agency about pending PPP complaints?

Very little. If a federal agency liaison has responded to our request for information in a particular case, OSC staff may state whether the PPP complaint is open or closed, but generally does not provide specific information about the matter, including our factual findings, the progress of our investigation, or the reasons for closing our file. In some cases, an agency may propose corrective action before OSC's investigation is finished. Before entering into settlement negotiations with an agency, OSC would obtain the consent of the complainant to pursue a potential resolution of the case.  ​​​

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

I work for the FBI. Can I file with OSC?

OSC has no jurisdiction to hear prohibited personnel practice claims from FBI employees.  FBI employees who allege retaliation for whistleblowing activities must seek a remedy under Department of Justice (DOJ) regulations.

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

My PPP case is before the MSPB. Can OSC file amicus curiae brief?

​Yes, under certain circumstances. OSC has the authority to formally submit its views on PPP cases pending before the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) in one of two ways: intervention or an amicus curiae (friend of the court) brief.

OSC may choose to intervene in matters it deems highly significant to the proper functioning of the merit system, including cases under the Whistleblower Protection Act. In certain types of cases, OSC must obtain the consent of the person who filed the appeal before intervening. Given our limited resources, OSC cannot intervene on most cases.

An _amicus curiae_ brief is a legal argument provided to a court by a person or group who is not a party to the case, but who could be affected by the legal questions it raises. OSC may submit _amicus curiae_ briefs to comment on legal issues that affect our ability to investigate and prosecute prohibited personnel practices. Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. § 1201.34(e), the MSPB has discretion to accept or reject these submissions.

If you would like OSC to consider a request to intervene or file an _amicus curiae_ brief, send an email to [amicus@osc.gov](mailto:amicus@osc.gov).  Please include:

1.  ​The case name and docket number, if they have been assigned;
2.  Whether you are requesting intervention or an _amicus curiae_ brief;
3.  What, if any, action the MSPB has taken in the matter to date;
4.  Whether any MSPB proceedings are scheduled and, if so, what they are about and when they will be held; and
5.  Why you are seeking OSC's participation, including a description of any novel or important legal issue in the proceeding.

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

How is a disclosure to OSC different from disclosures through other government channels?

*   Federal law guarantees your [confidentiality](services/pages/du-confidentiality.md);  
    
*   The Special Counsel may order the head of the agency involved to investigate and report on your disclosure; and
*   The Special Counsel may send the agency's report, and your comments, to the President and Congress.​​​​​  
    

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

What happens when you make a disclosure?

OSC does not independently investigate whistleblower disclosures. If the Special Counsel finds that the information you disclosed is, or is substantially likely to be, the type of wrongdoing described [here](services/pages/du-process.md), OSC will send the information to​ the head of the agency concerned. OSC will not divulge your identity unless you consent.

The agency head must conduct an investigation and submit a report to the OSC. The Special Counsel then sends the agency report, together with your comments and hers, if any, to the President and the appropriate congressional oversight committees.

​

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

What happens if the Special Counsel finds that the information you disclosed is not, or is not substantially likely to be, the type of wrongdoing that it can refer to an agency?

If the Special Counsel does not send your information to the agency head, OSC sends you a letter explaining why the Special Counsel did not refer the information. This letter will let you know what other disclosure channels may be available to you.​  

At their discretion, the Special Counsel may decide to send the information to the agency head, even if he or she does not find that it is, or is substantially likely to be, the type of wrongdoing described [here​](services/pages/du.md). If he or she does, the agency head is required to inform the Special Counsel in writing of what action has been or is being taken and when such action shall be completed. The Special Counsel will then inform you of the agency's report.  

​  

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

How long does it take?

You will usually hear from an OSC staff member within two weeks of filing your disclosure. The OSC staff member will explain the process and timing to you then.​​  

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

Are all employees, former employees, or applicants for employment in the federal government able to file a disclosure?

No. OSC does not have jurisdiction over disclosures filed by:  

*   Employees of the U.S. Postal Service and the Postal Regulatory Commission;
*   Members of the armed forces of the United States (i.e., non-civilian military employees);
*   State employees operating under federal grants;
*   Other employees or federal agencies exempt by federal law; and
*   Congressional or judicial branch employees

Certain disclosures that involve foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information must be transmitted immediately by the Special Counsel to the National Security Advisor and congressional intelligence committees.​​​​

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesFundraising

I am a federal employee and a supervisor. May I invite my subordinates to a fundraiser for a partisan political candidate or political party?

​No. Inviting subordinate employees to a political fundraiser would violate at least two provisions of the Hatch Act. First, inviting other individuals to a political fundraiser would violate the Act’s prohibition against soliciting, accepting, or receiving political contributions, even if the supervisory employee does not expressly ask the individuals to contribute money. Second, inviting subordinate employees to any political event would violate the Act’s prohibition against using one’s official authority or influence to affect the result of an election. Such conduct is inherently coercive, and violates the Act even if the supervisory employee does not threaten to penalize subordinates who do not attend or promise to reward those who do attend. Finally, inviting subordinates to a political fundraiser while at work would violate the Act’s prohibition  
against engaging in political activity while on duty or in a federal building or vehicle.

If an agency chooses to disseminate “news clips” to its employees, what are the best practices to avoid a Hatch Act violation?

OSC recognizes that many agencies disseminate news clips to employees.  And doing so, without more, does not violate the Hatch Act.  During an election season, however, many news articles are about candidates and elections, and the circulation of such materials could raise Hatch Act concerns.  Accordingly, agencies that circulate news clips to their employees should be mindful not to include articles, op-eds, or political commentary pieces that are directed at the success or failure of a political party, partisan political group, or candidate for partisan political office.​  

The following are the best practices for agencies that disseminate news stories to employees: ​  

*   In consultation with agency ethics officials who have Hatch Act-related duties, develop procedures for selecting and approving articles for agency distribution.
    
*   Designate an agency official responsible for reviewing news articles before dissemination.
    
*   When including general headline news, be mindful of the Hatch Act, particularly in an election year when many news stories are about the election.
    
*   Do not include political op-eds or other opinion pieces about candidates or political parties.
    
*   Do not include news stories about an agency official's political activity, such as speaking at a campaign event or endorsing a candidate.  
    

  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesParticipation in Political Party or Campaign Activities

May a manager/supervisor authorize paid administrative leave (excused absence) for the express or understood purpose of allowing an employee to perform work for a political party, partisan political group, or candidate for partisan political office?

No.  A manager or supervisor may not authorize paid administrative leave for the express or understood purpose of allowing an employee to perform paid or volunteer work for a political party, partisan political group, or candidate for partisan political office.  Doing so would, in effect, create a taxpayer-funded campaign staff.  That strikes at one of the core principles of the Hatch Act, namely that the power of the federal government should not be used to create “an unstoppable political machine."  H.R. Rep. No. 103-16, 8 (1993).

The relevant provision of the Hatch Act is 5 U.S.C. § 7323(a)(1), which prohibits an employee from using his official authority or influence to interfere with or affect an election.  A manager or supervisor authorizing paid administrative leave for the purpose of allowing an employee to work for a political party, partisan political group, or candidate for partisan political office undoubtedly benefits that party, group, or candidate.  Doing so is thus a misuse of official authority to interfere with or affect the result of an election.  Accordingly, a manager or supervisor may not authorize paid administrative leave for employees to work for a political party, partisan political group, or candidate for partisan political office.

Note that an employee who is granted paid administrative leave for some other, permissible reason is not prohibited from engaging in political activity during that period of administrative leave.  The Hatch Act regulations expressly state that an employee is not “on duty" for purposes of the Hatch Act when in “excused or authorized absence" status.  Therefore, an employee does not violate the Hatch Act merely by engaging in political activity while on administrative leave.  Of course, an employee on administrative leave must otherwise comply with the Hatch Act, e.g., the employee may not solicit, accept, or receive political contributions in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 7323(a)(3).  The concern we address here is a manager or supervisor granting paid administrative leave for the express or understood purpose of allowing an employee to engage in political activity, which is prohibited.​  

  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesActivity in the Workplace

May I wear or display partisan materials when I am teleworking and participating in a videoconference?

No.  Employees participating in virtual work-related conferences are subject to the same on-duty Hatch Act restrictions as when they attend meetings or communicate in-person with others at work.  Thus, for example, employees should not wear a campaign t-shirt or hat while participating in a work-related video conference call, and they should ensure that any partisan materials, like campaign signs or candidate pictures, are not visible to others during the call.  

  

For more information please refer to OSC’s advisory opinion for teleworking employees, which is available [here](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://osc.gov/Documents/Hatch%2520Act/Advisory%2520Opinions/Federal/Hatch%2520Act%2520Advisory%2520for%2520Teleworking%2520Employees.pdf&data=05%7c02%7c%7c945cdd185ce9490caa8308dc49d46686%7c39dcbe17c0694d7c8ad7efbbedb5fc55%7c0%7c0%7c638466423843306876%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7c0%7c%7c%7c&sdata=akg42K9D7ru5cFcst85XmVc8jVDBE/Fpwdbqwsl8iq0%3D&reserved=0).​​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesParticipation in Political Party or Campaign Activities

Can I solicit, accept, or receive contributions to support my campaign for an elected office within a political party (a “political party office”)?

**Less Restricted Employees:**  Yes, but not while on duty, in the federal workplace, or when wearing an agency uniform or insignia.  Because less restricted employees are permitted to run for a political party office, the Hatch Act does not prohibit less restricted employees from soliciting, accepting, or receiving contributions to finance a campaign for political party office.  However, because running for political party office is still viewed as “political activity," employees may not engage in any campaign-related activities—including soliciting, accepting, or receiving contributions—while on duty, in the federal workplace, or wearing an agency uniform or insignia. 

**​Further Restricted Employees:**  No, because further restricted employees may not run for political party office or otherwise take an active part in partisan political management.​  

  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesFundraising

Can I participate in a “tiered” political fundraiser where, for an additional contribution amount, attendees can meet with me, take a picture with me, or otherwise receive a special benefit related to my participation?

**Less Restricted Employees:**  No.  While a less restricted employee may be a guest speaker at a political fundraiser, provided the employee is off duty, appears only in a personal capacity, and does not solicit political contributions, a less restricted employee may not participate in a “tiered" fundraiser where the employee is directly linked to the fundraising effort. In other words, tiered contribution schemes typically use the employee as an enticement for donors to make additional contributions in return for special access to the employee.  An employee's grant of special access to donors in exchange for an additional contribution is akin to the employee soliciting the contribution.  Thus, such an exchange violates the Hatch Act's prohibition against soliciting, accepting, or receiving political contributions.    

**Further Restricted Employees:**  No, because further restricted employees may not be guest speakers at, or otherwise take an active part in, political fundraisers.  

  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesCandidacy ＆ Elections

May I serve as a poll worker, poll watcher, election official, or in any other capacity at the polls on election day?

**Less Restricted Employees:**  Generally yes.  The Hatch Act does not prohibit a less restricted federal employee from performing purely nonpartisan election administration duties on behalf of a state or local government, such as by serving as a municipal or county poll worker.   Performing such duties is not “political activity" as defined in 5 C.F.R. § 734.101.  However, other laws or regulations may apply.  Therefore, employees should consult with an agency ethics official to determine whether there are any other possible restrictions on serving as a poll worker on behalf of a state or local government, including whether employees may accept compensation for such service.  
  

The Hatch Act also does not prohibit a less restricted employee from working at the polls on behalf of a political party, partisan political group, or partisan campaign, such as by serving as a poll watcher or challenger, but certain restrictions do apply.  Because volunteering on behalf of a political party, partisan political group, or partisan campaign is political activity, a less restricted employee may not do so while on duty, wearing an agency uniform or insignia, or using a government-owned or -leased vehicle.  Provided that the employee complies with these restrictions, the Hatch Act does not prohibit a less restricted employee from working at the polls on behalf of, or in coordination with, a political party, partisan political group, or partisan campaign.  
  

**Further Restricted Employees:**  Possibly.  A further restricted employee is not prohibited from performing purely nonpartisan election administration duties on behalf of a state or local government, such as by serving as a municipal or county poll worker.  Some jurisdictions require that prospective poll workers identify their political party registration or affiliation during the application process.  Further restricted employees are not prohibited from listing their party registration or affiliation on application materials.  So long as the work the employee will perform on election day is purely nonpartisan and not on behalf of, or in coordination with, a political party, partisan political group, or partisan campaign, the Hatch Act would not prohibit the employee from working at the polls.  Further restricted employees should consult with an agency ethics official to determine whether there are any other possible restrictions on serving as a poll worker on behalf of a state or local government, including whether employees may accept compensation for such service.​  
  

Further restricted employees may not, however, work at the polls on behalf of, or in coordination with, a political party, partisan political group, or partisan campaign.  Accordingly, further restricted employees may not, for example, serve as poll watchers or challengers on behalf of a political party, partisan political group, or partisan campaign or otherwise act in concert with such a party, group, or campaign.​  

  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesCandidacy ＆ Elections

May I be a candidate in a partisan primary election?

No.  Federal employees may not be candidates for election to a partisan political office.  Any office for which candidates are selected via a partisan primary is a partisan political office.​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesCandidacy ＆ Elections

May I be a candidate in an election in which other candidates are nominated by a political party?

Generally not.  The Hatch Act prohibits employees from being candidates for election to a partisan political office.  A “partisan political office" is one for which _any_ candidate is nominated or elected as representing a political party.  Thus, if any candidates are nominated by a political party—and even if a federal employee is not—then the election is for a partisan political office.   

However, there are certain “designated localities" in which federal employees may run as _independent_ candidates for local partisan political office.  OPM designates these localities and lists them in [5 C.F.R. § 733.107](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-733/section-733.107&data=05%7c02%7c%7ccda7379b5b034dd0390108dc116b10b5%7c39dcbe17c0694d7c8ad7efbbedb5fc55%7c0%7c0%7c638404398798529500%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7c3000%7c%7c%7c&sdata=tzI38uHTO4wXzamKT3eyGZn3Lj20%2Bs0bTJ9lkuz23Lw%3D&reserved=0).  In order to maintain an independent candidacy, an employee generally may not (1) receive or advertise the endorsement of a political party, or (2) directly or indirectly work in concert with a political party to promote the employee's campaign.  ​  

OSC recommends that any employee interested in running for elected office contact OSC for information about how to ensure that their candidacy complies with the Hatch Act.    

  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesCandidacy ＆ Elections

I want to run for an elected office that is designated as nonpartisan under state or local law, meaning that candidates do not appear on the ballot with party affiliation. May I do so?

Possibly.  If political parties are not involved in the election, then the Hatch Act does not prohibit an employee from running in a nonpartisan election.   

However, under the Hatch Act, an election designated as nonpartisan under state or local law may still be considered an election for “partisan political office" if any candidate (1) is endorsed by a political party, or (2) directly or indirectly works in concert with a political party to promote the candidate's campaign.  If any candidate is endorsed by a party, or if any candidate directly or indirectly acts in concert with a party to promote the candidate's campaign, then that candidate will be considered to be representing that party in the election.  In that case, the election is for a partisan political office.  An employee interested in running in a nominally nonpartisan election must ensure that no candidates in the election are running as representing a party.​  

OSC recommends that any employee interested in running for elected office contact OSC for information about how to ensure that their candidacy complies with the Hatch Act.  

  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesCandidacy ＆ Elections

I am a candidate in an election designated as nonpartisan and will not seek or advertise a political party’s endorsement. However, I want to work with a political party to promote my candidacy. May I do so?

No.  Under governing case law, an election is for a partisan political office if any candidate works in concert with a party to promote the candidate's campaign.  Accordingly, even if an employee is not endorsed by a party, an employee may not, for example:  coordinate mailers, canvassing, or other campaign events with the party; accept volunteer or logistical support from a party; or seek and advertise the endorsement of party-affiliated groups, such as a party executive committee.  ​  

OSC recommends that any employee interested in running for elected office contact OSC for information about how to ensure that their candidacy complies with the Hatch Act.  

  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesParticipation in Political Party or Campaign Activities

May I hold a leadership position (chair, treasurer, manager, etc.) with a political party, partisan political group, or the campaign of a candidate for partisan political office?

**Less Restricted Employees:**  Yes, subject to some restrictions.  The Hatch Act does not categorically prohibit less restricted employees from taking an active part—including by holding a leadership position—with a political party, partisan political group, or the campaign of a candidate for partisan political office.  However, employees serving in such a position must otherwise comply with the Hatch Act.  This means that employees may not engage in any political activity while on duty, in a federal room or building, wearing an official uniform or insignia, or using a government vehicle.  Employees also may not use their official authority or influence to interfere with or affect the result of an election—such as by asking a subordinate to support a political party, partisan political group, or candidate for partisan political office—or solicit, accept, or receive political contributions.  If you have questions about a specific political activity, you may contact OSC to obtain further guidance.​  

**Further Restricted Employees:**  No.  The Hatch Act prohibits further restricted employees from taking an active part in political management or political campaigns.  This prohibition encompasses holding a leadership position with a political party, partisan political group, or the campaign of a candidate for partisan political office.  

  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesParticipation in Political Party or Campaign Activities

I have a leadership position in a political party or campaign for partisan political office. May my name appear on the party or campaign’s letterhead?

**Less Restricted Employees:**  Yes, unless the letterhead is used to solicit political contributions.  Because the Hatch Act prohibits an employee from soliciting, accepting, or receiving political contributions, an employee's name may not appear on letterhead soliciting such contributions.  For more information on political contributions see the Fundraising section of these FAQs. ​​  

**Further Restricted Employees:**  No, because a further restricted employee is prohibited from holding a leadership position in a political party or campaign.  

  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesParticipation in Political Party or Campaign Activities

I have a leadership position in a political party or campaign for partisan political office. May I perform ministerial duties related to funds already received by the party or campaign, such as accounting for such funds?

**Less Restricted Employees:**  Yes.  While the Hatch Act prohibits an employee from soliciting, accepting, or receiving political contributions, it does not prohibit employees from handling or accounting for funds already received by a political party or campaign.  Less restricted employees are similarly not prohibited from signing checks on behalf of a political party or campaign.​  

**Further Restricted Employees:**  No, because a further restricted employee is prohibited from holding a leadership position in a political party or campaign.

May I use a partisan image as the profile picture for my official email account or on other official software?

No.  While some email and other productivity tools allow users to add a profile picture, employees may not use the profile pictures associated with those platforms to show support for or opposition to a political party, partisan political group, or candidate for partisan political office.  For example, employees may not use candidate images, campaign slogans, or political party symbols for profile pictures associated with official accounts or when communicating on official matters.​

## USERRA

Who does USERRA cover?

USERRA provides civilian employment protections for members and veterans of the “uniformed services”, which includes the Armed Forces (active duty), National Guard or Reserves, and certain other uniformed services such as the National Disaster Medical System, FEMA Urban Search & Rescue, FEMA Reservists, and the Commissioned Corps of both the Public Health Service and NOAA​​  

## USERRA

Who investigates USERRA claims?

The U.S. Department of Labor, Veterans Employment and Training Service (DOL-VETS), investigates USERRA claims against all employers- federal, state, local, and private. Further information can be found under “How to File a USERRA Complaint" [here](services/pages/userra-filecomplaint.md).​

## USERRA

How long does a USERRA claim take?

DOL-VETS has 90 days to complete its investigation of USERRA claims, but may request an extension.​​​

If I am going away on military duty, do I need to give copies of my orders to my employer?

While it is best practice to provide copies of your military orders to your employer **prior** to performing your military duty (if possible), you are not required to do so. You are simply required to provide advance verbal or written notice that the absence is due to military service. However, upon your return, if your military service was for more than 30 days (or if you requested paid military leave for some or all of that service), your employer may request copies of your orders, but cannot delay your reemployment pending receipt of those orders.​​

## USERRA

When I return from military duty, do I have to report back to work right away?

​In order to obtain reemployment protections under USERRA when you return from military duty, you must report for work or request reemployment within a specific time period. Depending on the length of your military duty as follows:  

*   If you were on military duty for less than 30 days, you must report to work on the next regularly scheduled business day or shift that you normally work after time for safe travel plus eight hours' rest.  
    

*   ​​​For example, if an individual works a night shift and their military duty ends at 5:00pm on Monday January 1st, and their next regularly scheduled shift is a night shift at 8:00pm Monday January 1st, that individual would not have to report for that shift, but the next one (8:00pm on Tuesday, January 2nd).

*   ​​If you were on military duty for 31 to 180 days, you have to request reemployment within 14 days of the end of your military duty.
*   If you were on military duty for more than 180 days, you have to request reemployment within 90 days of the end of your military duty.

If an individual does not report within the proper time frame, she may be reemployed, but is subject to discipline by her employer for being absent without leave (AWOL) for the amount of time she exceeded the reporting period.​

​

## USERRA

How should my employer have me listed in their payroll system while I am on military duty?

​Employers should place service members in a leave without pay (LWOP) status while they are on military duty, unless the employee has paid leave that they wish to use for any of that time. Ideally, the LWOP entry should indicate that the employee is out for military service, as distinct from other types of LWOP such as a leave of absence or furlough; many employers designate this type of leave as LWOP-US or LWOP-MIL. Employees should **not** be placed on absent without leave status (AWOL), even pending submission of a copy of their orders.​

## Alternative Dispute Resolution

Why should I consider using OSC's mediation program?

OSC offers voluntary mediation in selected Prohibited Personnel Practice (PPP) cases between federal employee complainants and agencies.  There are several reasons why OSC's mediation program may be beneficial to both employees and agencies:

*   **_Confidentiality_** _–_ Mediation provides employees and agencies with an opportunity to explore and negotiate resolution of the employee's OSC complaint in a confidential setting.
*   **_Retain Control Over Outcome_** _–_ Employees and agencies are the sole decision-makers who determine if they will mediate and whether and how they will resolve the OSC complaint.
*   **_Experienced OSC Mediators_** _–_ Mediators are OSC attorneys who are trained in both mediation and PPP law, enabling them to understand the issues and to assist parties with brainstorming meaningful, creative, and innovative solutions.
*   **_Informal and Flexible Process_** _–_ Mediators collaborate with participants to ensure that the process is tailored to their specific needs.
*   **_Creative and Innovative Solutions_** _–_ Employees and agencies can customize resolution options to meet their specific needs, interests, and objectives.  
*   **_No Cost for Mediation Services_** _–_ There is no charge for OSC mediation services.​

Where are mediation sessions held?

Participants can choose to mediate online via Zoom for Government (FedRAMP) or Microsoft Teams (FedRAMP), or in-person at OSC's office in Washington, DC, or another convenient location, if travel funds permit.  ​

## Alternative Dispute Resolution

Who participates in the mediation session?

In addition to OSC mediators, the employee, their attorney (if applicable), and the agency's attorney and settlement official attend the mediation session.  OSC requires the agency settlement official (an agency management official with authority necessary to resolve the dispute) to attend the entire mediation session.  Any individuals who would be investigated by OSC as subjects of the complaint may not serve as the agency settlement official.​  

## Alternative Dispute Resolution

What should I expect if I choose OSC mediation?

If OSC offers mediation, and both the employee and agency agree to participate in mediation, all mediation participants will be asked to sign an Agreement to Mediate, and the pre-mediation process will begin.  During the pre-mediation process, mediators engage in confidential discussions with each party to better understand their perspectives and interests; facilitate information sharing; brainstorm potential options for resolution; and convey initial offers and counteroffers.  Participants are expected to engage actively in the pre-mediation process.  Cases may settle prior to the mediation session as the employee and agency share resolution options.

The initial mediation session is generally scheduled for 2-3 months after the employee and agency agree to mediation.  Throughout the process, mediation remains voluntary; anyone may withdraw at any time.  ​  

## Alternative Dispute Resolution

How often do cases settle in mediation, and what happens if the case does not settle?

At OSC, more than two-thirds of completed mediations result in settlement.  If the employee and agency reach a mutually-agreeable resolution, they will then write and sign a settlement agreement.  If the employee and agency do not reach a settlement, the case will be transferred back to the OSC investigative attorney.  Anything discussed during the mediation process remains confidential.​

Is the program voluntary?

The requirement to inform agency employees of the rights and remedies available to them under the PPP and whistleblower provisions of Title 5 is a statutory obligation. 5 U.S.C. § 2302(d)[​](lists/faqs/editform.md). In late 2017, the President signed two pieces of legislation requiring the head of each agency, in consultation with OSC, and the Inspector General of the agency, to take steps such as providing annual training to supervisors. These steps may be satistfied under OSC's Certification Program.  

## Outreach Training

What are the consequences of failing to comply with the statutory obligation?

​OSC will report annually to Congress on federal agencies’ participation with the OSC's Certification Program.​  

## Outreach Training

How do I know if my agency is currently in compliance with OSC’s Certification Program?

OSC maintains lists of [registered agencies​](pages/2302cregistered.md) and [certified agencies​](pages/2302status.md) on this website. Additionally, you may e-mail [certification@osc.gov​](mailto:certification@osc.gov)​ or call (202) 804-7163 to discuss what outreach activities your agency is currently engaged in. You will be informed if your agency is in compliance and what, if any, additional actions your agency will need to take to become certified under OSC’s program.​​​

Is the No FEAR Act training sufficient to meet the supervisory training requirement?

In general, the No FEAR Act training will not be sufficient to meet the supervisory training requirement. The supervisory training should cover all 14 of the PPPs. With respect to PPPs, most No FEAR Act training programs only cover retaliation claims.  

## Outreach Training

Are government corporations subject to the Section 2302 requirements and required to complete certification?

​Under 5 U.S.C. § 2302(a)(c)(i), employees of government corporations are covered by the two retaliation prohibitions \[5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(8), (b)(9)\], while most other federal employees are covered by all 14 prohibited personnel practices. Therefore, government corporations are required to certify, but only with respect to the retaliation prohibitions.

## Outreach Training

Once I register for the program, how will I know that my agency is in compliance with OSC’s Certification Program?

If you have registered for the program, after completing the five requirements, you will be asked to submit a certificate of compliance form and documentation. After OSC approves the submission, OSC will grant you a certificate of compliance. Additionally, we list certified agencies on OSC's website and report federal agencies' compliance with OSC's Certification Program annually to Congress.​​​​​​

## Outreach Training

How often will agencies need to be certified as being in compliance with OSC’s Certification Program?

Agencies need to complete a checklist (coming soon) each year and submit a compliance form every three years.​​

## Outreach Training

How often does an agency need to train supervisors on PPPs and the Whistleblower Protection Act/Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (WPA/WPEA)?

In consultation with OSC, agencies need to train supervisors every three years on PPPs and whistleblower disclosures and each year on how to respond to complaints alleging a violation of whistleblower protections.​  

## Outreach Training

How often do employees need to be notified of their rights and remedies under the WPA/WPEA?

Employees must be notified annually.​​  

## Outreach Training

Will this program generate frivolous complaints?

Our experience is that agency-wide education programs have not resulted in a substantial increase in the number of complaints filed by employees of that agency, and often, such training helps prevent PPPs from occurring.​

## Outreach Training

If an agency has employees that are not covered by all Title 5 provisions, will they need to certify under OSC’s program?

Some agencies have federal employees who are only covered by a limited number of Title 5 provisions. If any provisions of the WPA/WPEA cover these employees, the agency is responsible for informing the employees of their rights and responsibilities under the statute, and certifying under the relevant provisions of OSC’s program.​  

## Outreach Training

What is 2302(c) certification?

OSC's 2302(c) Certification Program allows federal agencies to meet the statutory obligation to inform their workforces about the rights and remedies available to them under the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA), the Whistleblower Protection and Enhancement Act (WPEA), and related civil service laws. 5 U.S.C. § 2302(c). It also allows agencies to meet the requirements of the second Open Government National Action Plan. Under the 2302(c) Certification Program, OSC will certify an agency's compliance if the agency meets the following five requirements:

1.  Placing informational posters at agency facilities;
2.  Providing information to ​​new employees about the WPA/WPEA (including the 13 PPPs) as part of the orientation process;
3.  Providing information to current employees on an annual basis about the WPA/WPEA;
4.  Training supervisors every three years on the WPA/WPEA; and
5.  Displaying a link to OSC's website on the agency's website or intranet.
