## Prohibited Personnel Practices

What documents should I provide to assist my complaints examiner?

Each PPP complaint is different, so each involves different documents. However, there are some documents that will almost always be necessary when reviewing a complaint. If the federal agency has proposed or taken an action against you, whether disciplinary or performance-based, you should provide the proposal, the decision, and any response you provided to the agency. For example, if the agency has proposed your removal, give OSC a copy of that proposal and your response, if you submitted one. If the agency put you on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), provide a copy of your most recent performance appraisal as well as the letter you received from the agency putting you on the PIP. In assessing whether to submit a document to OSC, focus on materials that are directly relevant to the complaint. Submitting large volumes of documents that are not related to the complaint that OSC is examining can delay the investigation of a complaint.​​ You should always maintain the originals of all documents provided to OSC. Only send OSC copies of your supporting documentation, unless otherwise requested.

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

May I submit recordings to help document my case?

​Generally OSC will not consider unsolicited audio or video recordings in assessing the merits of your complaint.  If any recordings are submitted, OSC will retain them as part of the record and they will not be returned to you, so do not send an original or sole copy of any video or audio recording.​

Please note before sending any recording to OSC that most agencies have policies that prohibit recordings of conversations at work without the participants' consent. In addition, state laws often require the consent of all parties to a conversation. _See_ [state's recording laws](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://recordinglaw.com/united-states-recording-laws/&data=05%7c02%7c%7c5b8923a86c6f4259da3708dc138af246%7c39dcbe17c0694d7c8ad7efbbedb5fc55%7c0%7c0%7c638406734700862935%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7c3000%7c%7c%7c&sdata=fz5bniuHgna4oR%2BrkVVNX5jDfimOx8WZTZSjBCyTZhQ%3D&reserved=0).​  

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

Does OSC publish PPP reports containing its investigative findings and analyses?

​Under the “routine use” provisions of the Privacy Act, OSC may decide to publish its findings and analysis in a PPP case, typically contained in a PPP report, when there is a “legitimate public interest” in publishing the report. Legitimate public interests may include situations where guidance from OSC would be helpful on a legal or factual issue in the case; where the case involves a novel or emerging area of the law or a high level of media and/or congressional interest; or where publication would be educational for the federal government workforce. In such circumstances, OSC would redact personally identifiable information from the PPP report, and advise the complainant and agency about OSC’s intent to publish the report. Such publications are typically accompanied by a press release.​

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

Does OSC seek discipline against employees who commit a PPP?

​OSC may seek disciplinary action against an employee who commits a PPP. OSC uses different statutory provisions when it seeks disciplinary action than the provisions it uses for corrective action. OSC considers a number of factors when making the decision to seek disciplinary action, and consistent with the applicable statutory provisions, OSC’s decision to seek disciplinary action is within OSC’s prosecutorial discretion. Additionally, in some instances, OSC may not be able to disclose to the individual who filed the complaint the disciplinary action taken against the employee who committed a PPP.    

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

What are prohibited personnel practices (PPPs)?

Prohibited personnel practices, commonly called PPPs, are employment-related activities that are banned in the federal workforce because they violate the merit system through some form of employment discrimination; retaliation; improper hiring practices; or failure to adhere to laws, rules, and regulations that concern the merit system principles.​  

## Prohibited Personnel PracticesFiling Complaints

OSC’s information says most employees, applicants, and former employees can file PPP complaints. Can you explain who fits those categories?

An employee is a person appointed in the civil service and engaged in the performance of a federal function. The full definition appears at 5 U.S.C. §2105. An applicant is a person who has applied for a position described above. A former employee is a person who formerly held a position described above.

## Prohibited Personnel PracticesFiling Complaints

I am a VA patient. Can I file a PPP complaint at OSC?

​No. OSC does not have jurisdiction over complaints from patients of the Department of Veterans Affairs regarding their treatment at a VA facility. OSC also lacks jurisdiction over complaints of fraud with respect to VA benefits. If you have such a complaint, we recommend you contact the VA's Office of Inspector General at 1-800-488-8244.​​​  

## Prohibited Personnel PracticesFiling Complaints

I have filed a union grievance and/or MSPB appeal. Can I still file a PPP complaint at OSC?

Maybe. If you have already filed a union grievance or an appeal with the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), there is an additional restriction on your ability to file a PPP complaint. The​ law requires that you select only one of three options to address an “otherwise appealable action.” 5 U.S.C. § 7121(g). Otherwise appealable actions include: adverse actions (removals, suspensions that exceed 14 days, reductions in grade or pay, and furloughs for 30 days or less), performance-based removals or reductions in grade, denials of within-grade salary increases, reduction-in-force actions, and denials of  
restoration or reemployment rights. Thus, if you experienced one of these actions, you may choose only one route to pursue your PPP complaint: (1) a PPP complaint at OSC; (2) a MSPB appeal; or (3) a union grievance. You will be bound by the first option you choose and cannot change your mind if you are dissatisfied with the outcome of the first option chosen. Please note that, if you have  
filed an MSPB appeal, and your filing has not been, or is not likely to be, dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, OSC will not pursue your PPP complaint because we are bound by the MSPB’s decisions. Similarly, if your union grievance or MSPB appeal has reached a federal court, OSC may not be able to pursue your PPP complaint because we would be bound by the court’s decision on certain issues.​​

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

My PPP case is before the MSPB. Can OSC intervene in my case?

Yes, under certain circumstances. OSC has the authority to formally submit its views on PPP cases pending before the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) in one of two ways: intervention or an amicus curiae (friend of the court) brief.

OSC may choose to intervene in matters it deems highly significant to the proper functioning of the merit system, including cases under the Whistleblower Protection Act. In certain types of cases, OSC must obtain the consent of the person who filed the appeal before intervening. Given our limited resources, OSC cannot intervene on most cases.  

An amicus curiae brief is a legal argument provided to a court by a person or group who is not a party to the case, but who could be affected by the legal questions it raises. OSC may submit amicus curiae briefs to comment on legal issues that affect our ability to investigate and prosecute prohibited personnel practices. Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. § 1201.34(e), the MSPB has discretion to accept or reject these submissions.

​If you would like OSC to consider a request to intervene or file an amicus curiae brief, send an email to amicus@osc.gov.  Please include:​  

1.  The case name and docket number, if they have been assigned;  
    
2.  Whether you are requesting intervention or an amicus curiae brief;  
    
3.  What, if any, action the MSPB has taken in the matter to date;  
    
4.  Whether any MSPB proceedings are scheduled and, if so, what they are about and when they will be held; and  
    
5.  Why you are seeking OSC’s participation, including a description of any novel or important legal issue in the proceeding.​​

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

My PPP case is in federal court. Can OSC file amicus curiae brief?

​Maybe. An _amicus curiae_ (friend of the court) brief is a legal argument provided to a court by a person or group who is not a party to the case, but who could be affected by the legal questions it raises. OSC may file amicus curiae briefs in federal court cases that contain novel or significant issues of law with respect to 5 U.S.C.  § 2302(b)(8) (whistleblower retaliation) or 5 U.S.C.  § 2302(b)(9) (retaliation for engaging in protected activities), but not in cases involving other PPPs. Please note that while OSC is permitted file amicus curiae briefs in federal court, we cannot assist private litigants in other ways.

​If you would like OSC to consider submitting an _amicus curiae_ brief in your pending federal court case, send an email to [amicus@osc.gov](mailto:amicus@osc.gov).  Please include:  

1.  The case name and docket number, if they have been assigned;
2.  What, if any, action the court has taken in the matter to date;
3.  Whether any court proceedings are scheduled and, if so, what they are about and when they will be held; and  
    
4.  Why you are seeking OSC's assistance, including a description of any novel or important legal issue in the proceeding. ​  
    

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

My PPP case was wrongly decided by the MSPB or a federal court. Can OSC assist me?

​No. OSC cannot change a final ruling by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) or a federal court. If your PPP case is or can be appealed, OSC may submit an amicus curiae brief before the MSPB regarding any PPP case, or before a federal court regarding only a case’s impact on the PPPs involving whistleblower retaliation law (see above). OSC cannot provide legal advice on whether to appeal your case, or whether your case may be appealed.​​  

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

How can I disclose fraud, waste, and abuse?

If you choose to make a disclosure at OSC, please submit it through our online system (under "[file a complaint](pages/file-complaint.md)") or by printing form [OSC-14](~assets/documents/OSC-Form-14.pdf) and emailing it to [info@osc.gov​](mailto:info@osc.gov).  

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

What is the difference between filing a PPP complaint with OSC and making a whistleblower disclosure to OSC?

​OSC investigates and prosecutes PPP complaints involving 13 specific practices that have been made illegal in the federal workforce. 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b). In most cases, PPP complaints are filed to challenge a personnel action that directly affects an employee for a prohibited reason.

OSC also serves as a safe conduit for the receipt and evaluation of whistleblower disclosures from federal employees, applicants, and former employees. 5 U.S.C. § 1213. This evaluation process is separate and distinct from processing PPP complaints of retaliation for whistleblowing activities.​  

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

Should I list witnesses in my PPP complaint?

OSC can usually make a determination regarding whether to refer a complaint for further investigation without interviewing witnesses. However, it can be helpful to send a list of people who took part in, or have knowledge of, the incident(s) described in your PPP complaint.​

## Prohibited Personnel Practices

How do I add additional information about my PPP complaint?

You can provide additional information by mail, fax, or email. Please be sure to include your name and complaint number (MA-XX-XXXX) in any submission. With this information, OSC can ensure that the materials you send are given to the correct complaints examiner, even if you do not know his or her name or contact information. It is not necessary for you to submit a new Form OSC-11 in order to add new information to your PPP complaint.​​​ Please do not send original documents, as we are not always able to return original documents upon request. Instead, send copies of the documents you wish to have reviewed.​

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

How is a disclosure to OSC different from disclosures through other government channels?

*   Federal law guarantees your [confidentiality](services/pages/du-confidentiality.md);  
    
*   The Special Counsel may order the head of the agency involved to investigate and report on your disclosure; and
*   The Special Counsel may send the agency's report, and your comments, to the President and Congress.​​​​​  
    

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

What happens when you make a disclosure?

OSC does not independently investigate whistleblower disclosures. If the Special Counsel finds that the information you disclosed is, or is substantially likely to be, the type of wrongdoing described [here](services/pages/du-process.md), OSC will send the information to​ the head of the agency concerned. OSC will not divulge your identity unless you consent.

The agency head must conduct an investigation and submit a report to the OSC. The Special Counsel then sends the agency report, together with your comments and hers, if any, to the President and the appropriate congressional oversight committees.

​

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

What happens if the Special Counsel finds that the information you disclosed is not, or is not substantially likely to be, the type of wrongdoing that it can refer to an agency?

If the Special Counsel does not send your information to the agency head, OSC sends you a letter explaining why the Special Counsel did not refer the information. This letter will let you know what other disclosure channels may be available to you.​  

At their discretion, the Special Counsel may decide to send the information to the agency head, even if he or she does not find that it is, or is substantially likely to be, the type of wrongdoing described [here​](services/pages/du.md). If he or she does, the agency head is required to inform the Special Counsel in writing of what action has been or is being taken and when such action shall be completed. The Special Counsel will then inform you of the agency's report.  

​  

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

How long does it take?

You will usually hear from an OSC staff member within two weeks of filing your disclosure. The OSC staff member will explain the process and timing to you then.​​  

## Disclosure of Wrongdoing

Are all employees, former employees, or applicants for employment in the federal government able to file a disclosure?

No. OSC does not have jurisdiction over disclosures filed by:  

*   Employees of the U.S. Postal Service and the Postal Regulatory Commission;
*   Members of the armed forces of the United States (i.e., non-civilian military employees);
*   State employees operating under federal grants;
*   Other employees or federal agencies exempt by federal law; and
*   Congressional or judicial branch employees

Certain disclosures that involve foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information must be transmitted immediately by the Special Counsel to the National Security Advisor and congressional intelligence committees.​​​​

## Hatch ActFederal Employees

Is a Hatch Act investigation an administrative or criminal matter?

A Hatch Act investigation is an administrative matter. Hatch Act matters are adjudicated before the Merit Systems Protection Board, which is an administrative agency. However, federal employees also should be aware that certain political activities may also be criminal offenses under title 18 of the U.S. Code. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 210, 211, 594, 595, 600, 601, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607, 610.​​

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesActivity in the Workplace

Can I wear a face mask or other personal protective equipment (PPE) to work if the PPE has a partisan political image or slogan?

No.  Federal employees may not engage in political activity while on duty or in the workplace.  This restriction prohibits employees from wearing partisan political buttons or T-shirts while on duty or in the workplace.  It similarly prohibits employees from wearing face masks, face shields, gloves, or other PPE that feature, for example, a picture of a candidate for partisan political office, a campaign slogan, or the name or logo of a political party.

​ 

  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesCandidacy ＆ Elections

May I serve as a presidential elector?

**Less Restricted Employees:**  The Hatch Act does not prohibit a less restricted employee from serving as a presidential elector.  Presidential electors are selected by a political party to vote in the Electoral College for that party's nominees for president and vice president.  Electors do not have any role in government other than casting their electoral vote.  Thus, electors hold positions within a political party, rather than elected positions within the government, which is permissible for less restricted employees.   

Less restricted employees should be aware that Article II, section 1 of the U.S. Constitution states that “no . . . person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States, shall be appointed an elector."  We recommend that less restricted employees who are interested in serving as electors consult with outside counsel or their state elections office about this constitutional issue.​  
  

**Further Restricted Employees:**  No.  Further restricted employees are prohibited from acting in concert with a political party or candidate for partisan political office.  Because serving as a presidential elector involves accepting a political party's nomination for the position and then voting on behalf of that party in the Electoral College, the Hatch Act prohibits further restricted employees from serving as electors.

   

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesParticipation in Political Party or Campaign Activities

What is a partisan political group?

Partisan political groups are defined in the Hatch Act as those groups that (1) are affiliated with a political party or candidate for public office in a partisan election, (2) are organized for a partisan purpose, or (3) engage in partisan political activity.  Under (1), any organization that is recognized by a national or state political party as a club, auxiliary, authorized committee, or other affiliated organization is a partisan political group.  Under (2), any organization formed to support or oppose one or more political parties—or a party's candidates for partisan political office—is a partisan political group.  As for (3), OSC evaluates organizations on a case-by-case basis.  When doing so, OSC considers several factors including, but not limited to, the following:  the organization's stated purpose, as reflected in its bylaws or charter, on its website, and in its other public materials; whether the organization expends its resources on political activity; whether the organization prominently advertises its political activity; the relationship between the organization and its affiliates, if any, that engage in political activity, such as whether they share a website, staff, or office space; and whether the organization has indicated on any government filings that it engages in political activity.​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesParticipation in Political Party or Campaign Activities

Are organizations that are tax-exempt under section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code (501(c)(4) organizations) partisan political groups?

Possibly.  Many 501(c)(4) organizations, or “social welfare organizations," work primarily or exclusively on issue advocacy, in which case OSC would generally not find them to be partisan political groups.  Others, however, engage in some political activity, _i.e._, activity directed toward the success or failure of a political party, partisan political group, or candidate for partisan political office.  In some cases, OSC has found that the amount of political activity a 501(c)(4) organization engages in is so extensive that the organization is a partisan political group for purposes of the Hatch Act.  ​  
  

For example, OSC has previously concluded that when a 501(c)(4) organization and a political action committee operate collectively under a single brand identity, engage in political activity under that shared identity, and also share an executive director, logo, website, and social media accounts, then that 501(c)(4) organization is a partisan political group.  In other cases, OSC might conclude that a 501(c)(4) organization operating independently is a partisan political group if, for example, it spends its resources on political activity, prominently advertises that political activity, and has indicated on government filings that it engages in political activity.  Such determinations are made on a case-by-case basis.​  
  

Even if OSC concludes that a 501(c)(4) organization is not a partisan political group, employees should still be cautious about engaging in any 501(c)(4)-related activity while at work.  This is because some 501(c)(4) organizations that are not partisan political groups may still engage in some political activity, such as by endorsing a candidate for partisan political office.  Because the endorsement meets the Hatch Act's definition of political activity, the Hatch Act would prohibit an employee from, for example, sharing a press release announcing that endorsement while the employee is on duty or in the workplace.   

  

## Hatch ActGeneral

A Hatch Act complaint has been filed against me, can I find out who filed it?

As a general matter, OSC staff may not disclose the name of the person who filed a Hatch Act complaint. OSC’s program files, including Hatch Act complaints, contain personal or sensitive information, which is generally protected from release under the Freedom of Information Act. Release of the names of individuals who have reported suspected Hatch Act violations is generally considered to be an unwarranted invasion of privacy that could interfere with OSC’s law enforcement efforts by subjecting such individuals, on whom OSC relies to report potential violations, to possible harassment or reprisal for doing so. For more information about this policy please refer to  
[1/26/2004 Policy Statement on Disclosure of Information from OSC Program Files (OSC49a)](/Documents/PPP/Policy%20Statements/Policy%20Statement%20on%20Disclosure%20of%20Information%20from%20OSC%20Program%20Files.pdf).​​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesActivity in the Workplace

Can I display a picture of a candidate for partisan political office in my workspace?

Because section 7324 of the Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from engaging in political activity while on duty or in a federal building, the Act generally would prohibit employees from displaying pictures of candidates for partisan public office in the federal workplace. [5 C.F.R. § 734.306​](http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/5/734.306), Example 16. However, we advise that an employee would not be prohibited from having a photograph of a candidate in his office if all of the following apply: the photograph was on display in advance of the election season; the employee is in the photograph with the candidate; and the photograph is a personal one (i.e., the employee has a personal relationship with the candidate and the photograph is taken at some kind of personal event or function, for example, a wedding, and not at a campaign event or some other type of partisan political event). Of course, an employee must not have a political purpose for displaying the photograph, namely, promoting or opposing a political party or a candidate for partisan political office.​​​​​  

​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesActivity in the Workplace

Can I wear a partisan political button or T-shirt while I am at work or display such items in my office?

No. Covered employees may not engage in political activity while on duty, in a government office or building, in uniform, or in a government vehicle. Wearing or displaying candidate, political party, or political group materials while on duty or in your work space qualifies as political activity. This prohibition extends to wearing or displaying such items in, for example, the cafeteria, lobby, or on-site gym of a federal building.​​​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesActivity in the Workplace

Can I have a screen saver on my computer or a picture in my office with a political message (e.g., a campaign sign, campaign logo, etc.)?

No. Covered employees may not engage in political activity while on duty, in a government office or building, in uniform, or in a government vehicle. Displaying campaign material qualifies as political activity.​​​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesActivity in the Workplace

If I have a bumper sticker on my personal car, am I allowed to park the car in a government lot or garage, or in a private lot/garage if the government subsidizes my parking fees?

Yes. An employee is allowed to park his or her privately owned vehicle with a bumper sticker in a government lot or garage. An employee may also park the car with a bumper sticker in a private lot or garage for which the employee receives a subsidy from his or her agency.​​​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesActivity in the Workplace

Will I violate the Hatch Act if I listen to radio programs discussing partisan politics or candidates for partisan political office, or read a book about politics or political candidates while I am in the federal workplace?

No. Some federal agencies allow employees to listen to the radio while they are at work. Merely listening to a radio program that is discussing politics while in the federal workplace, without more, is not a Hatch Act violation. Similarly, merely reading a book about politics or political candidates while in the federal workplace, without more, is not a Hatch Act violation. However, employees should make certain that the federal agency where they work does not have any internal policies prohibiting its employees from generally engaging in any of these activities while at work (i.e., listening to the radio, reading).​​​​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesActivity in the Workplace

Is it a Hatch Act violation for a federal agency to have televisions in the federal workplace that are tuned to stations such as Fox News or MSNBC?

No. Watching, or allowing the broadcast of, stations such as Fox News or MSNBC in the federal workplace, without more, does not violate the Hatch Act. Thus, while some federal agencies may have televisions located in lobbies or other public areas within a federal workplace that are tuned to such stations the Hatch Act does not prohibit them from doing so.​​​  

## Hatch ActFederal EmployeesActivity in the Workplace

If the sitting President is a candidate for reelection, may federal employees display his or her picture in their offices?

An employee covered by the Hatch Act may not engage in political activity while on duty, in a government room or building, while wearing an official uniform, or using a government vehicle. [5 U.S.C. § 7324​](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=%28title:5%20section:7324%20edition:prelim%29). Political activity is defined as activity directed toward the success or failure of a political party, candidate for a partisan political office, or partisan political group. [5 C.F.R. § 734.101​](http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/5/734.101).

Thus, the Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from, among other things, displaying pictures of candidates for partisan public office in the federal workplace. [5 C.F.R. § 734.306​](http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/5/734.306), Example 16. If the President is a candidate for reelection, the Hatch Act prohibits an employee from displaying his or her photograph in the federal workplace, unless one of the two exceptions discussed below applies.

The first exception applies to official photographs of the President. The Hatch Act does not prohibit the continued display of official photographs of the President in the federal workplace, to include both public and employee work spaces. Official photographs include the traditional portrait photo of the President displayed in all federal buildings, as well as photographs of the President conducting official business (e.g., President meeting with heads of state). However, these official photographs must be displayed in a traditional size and manner and should not be altered in any way (e.g., the addition of halos or horns). Pictures that are distributed by the President's campaign or a partisan organization, such as the Democratic National Committee or Organizing for America, are not official, even if they depict the President performing an official act. Similarly, pictures downloaded from the internet or clipped from magazines or newspapers, screen savers, and life-size cutouts are not official photographs for purposes of this exception.

The second exception, which applies to all candidate photographs, concerns personal employee photographs. An employee would not be prohibited from having a photograph of any candidate in his or her office, if all of the following apply: the photograph was on display in advance of the election season; the employee is in the photograph with the candidate; and the photograph is a personal one (i.e., the employee has a personal relationship with the candidate and the photograph is taken at some kind of personal event or function, for example, a wedding, and not at a campaign event or some other type of partisan political event). An employee must not have a political purpose for displaying the photograph, namely, promoting or opposing a political party or a candidate for partisan political office.

If you have any questions, please contact our office for additional guidance.​​​

Can a federal employee display in his office a photograph of his spouse or child even if the spouse or child is a candidate in an election for partisan political office?

Yes. The Hatch Act does not prohibit a federal employee from displaying photographs of a spouse or child even if the spouse or child is currently running for partisan political office, provided the photograph is not a campaign photograph.​​

## USERRA

Who does USERRA cover?

USERRA provides civilian employment protections for members and veterans of the “uniformed services”, which includes the Armed Forces (active duty), National Guard or Reserves, and certain other uniformed services such as the National Disaster Medical System, FEMA Urban Search & Rescue, FEMA Reservists, and the Commissioned Corps of both the Public Health Service and NOAA​​  

## USERRA

Who investigates USERRA claims?

The U.S. Department of Labor, Veterans Employment and Training Service (DOL-VETS), investigates USERRA claims against all employers- federal, state, local, and private. Further information can be found under “How to File a USERRA Complaint" [here](services/pages/userra-filecomplaint.md).​

## USERRA

How long does a USERRA claim take?

DOL-VETS has 90 days to complete its investigation of USERRA claims, but may request an extension.​​​

## USERRA

If I am going away on military duty, do I need to give copies of my orders to my employer?

While it is best practice to provide copies of your military orders to your employer **prior** to performing your military duty (if possible), you are not required to do so. You are simply required to provide advance verbal or written notice that the absence is due to military service. However, upon your return, if your military service was for more than 30 days (or if you requested paid military leave for some or all of that service), your employer may request copies of your orders, but cannot delay your reemployment pending receipt of those orders.​​

## USERRA

When I return from military duty, do I have to report back to work right away?

​In order to obtain reemployment protections under USERRA when you return from military duty, you must report for work or request reemployment within a specific time period. Depending on the length of your military duty as follows:  

*   If you were on military duty for less than 30 days, you must report to work on the next regularly scheduled business day or shift that you normally work after time for safe travel plus eight hours' rest.  
    

*   ​​​For example, if an individual works a night shift and their military duty ends at 5:00pm on Monday January 1st, and their next regularly scheduled shift is a night shift at 8:00pm Monday January 1st, that individual would not have to report for that shift, but the next one (8:00pm on Tuesday, January 2nd).

*   ​​If you were on military duty for 31 to 180 days, you have to request reemployment within 14 days of the end of your military duty.
*   If you were on military duty for more than 180 days, you have to request reemployment within 90 days of the end of your military duty.

If an individual does not report within the proper time frame, she may be reemployed, but is subject to discipline by her employer for being absent without leave (AWOL) for the amount of time she exceeded the reporting period.​

​

## USERRA

How should my employer have me listed in their payroll system while I am on military duty?

​Employers should place service members in a leave without pay (LWOP) status while they are on military duty, unless the employee has paid leave that they wish to use for any of that time. Ideally, the LWOP entry should indicate that the employee is out for military service, as distinct from other types of LWOP such as a leave of absence or furlough; many employers designate this type of leave as LWOP-US or LWOP-MIL. Employees should **not** be placed on absent without leave status (AWOL), even pending submission of a copy of their orders.​

Why should I consider using OSC's mediation program?

OSC offers voluntary mediation in selected Prohibited Personnel Practice (PPP) cases between federal employee complainants and agencies.  There are several reasons why OSC's mediation program may be beneficial to both employees and agencies:

*   **_Confidentiality_** _–_ Mediation provides employees and agencies with an opportunity to explore and negotiate resolution of the employee's OSC complaint in a confidential setting.
*   **_Retain Control Over Outcome_** _–_ Employees and agencies are the sole decision-makers who determine if they will mediate and whether and how they will resolve the OSC complaint.
*   **_Experienced OSC Mediators_** _–_ Mediators are OSC attorneys who are trained in both mediation and PPP law, enabling them to understand the issues and to assist parties with brainstorming meaningful, creative, and innovative solutions.
*   **_Informal and Flexible Process_** _–_ Mediators collaborate with participants to ensure that the process is tailored to their specific needs.
*   **_Creative and Innovative Solutions_** _–_ Employees and agencies can customize resolution options to meet their specific needs, interests, and objectives.  
*   **_No Cost for Mediation Services_** _–_ There is no charge for OSC mediation services.​

Where are mediation sessions held?

Participants can choose to mediate online via Zoom for Government (FedRAMP) or Microsoft Teams (FedRAMP), or in-person at OSC's office in Washington, DC, or another convenient location, if travel funds permit.  ​

## Alternative Dispute Resolution

Who participates in the mediation session?

In addition to OSC mediators, the employee, their attorney (if applicable), and the agency's attorney and settlement official attend the mediation session.  OSC requires the agency settlement official (an agency management official with authority necessary to resolve the dispute) to attend the entire mediation session.  Any individuals who would be investigated by OSC as subjects of the complaint may not serve as the agency settlement official.​  

## Alternative Dispute Resolution

What should I expect if I choose OSC mediation?

If OSC offers mediation, and both the employee and agency agree to participate in mediation, all mediation participants will be asked to sign an Agreement to Mediate, and the pre-mediation process will begin.  During the pre-mediation process, mediators engage in confidential discussions with each party to better understand their perspectives and interests; facilitate information sharing; brainstorm potential options for resolution; and convey initial offers and counteroffers.  Participants are expected to engage actively in the pre-mediation process.  Cases may settle prior to the mediation session as the employee and agency share resolution options.

The initial mediation session is generally scheduled for 2-3 months after the employee and agency agree to mediation.  Throughout the process, mediation remains voluntary; anyone may withdraw at any time.  ​  

## Alternative Dispute Resolution

How often do cases settle in mediation, and what happens if the case does not settle?

At OSC, more than two-thirds of completed mediations result in settlement.  If the employee and agency reach a mutually-agreeable resolution, they will then write and sign a settlement agreement.  If the employee and agency do not reach a settlement, the case will be transferred back to the OSC investigative attorney.  Anything discussed during the mediation process remains confidential.​

Is the program voluntary?

The requirement to inform agency employees of the rights and remedies available to them under the PPP and whistleblower provisions of Title 5 is a statutory obligation. 5 U.S.C. § 2302(d)[​](lists/faqs/editform.md). In late 2017, the President signed two pieces of legislation requiring the head of each agency, in consultation with OSC, and the Inspector General of the agency, to take steps such as providing annual training to supervisors. These steps may be satistfied under OSC's Certification Program.  

## Outreach Training

What are the consequences of failing to comply with the statutory obligation?

​OSC will report annually to Congress on federal agencies’ participation with the OSC's Certification Program.​  

## Outreach Training

How do I know if my agency is currently in compliance with OSC’s Certification Program?

OSC maintains lists of [registered agencies​](pages/2302cregistered.md) and [certified agencies​](pages/2302status.md) on this website. Additionally, you may e-mail [certification@osc.gov​](mailto:certification@osc.gov)​ or call (202) 804-7163 to discuss what outreach activities your agency is currently engaged in. You will be informed if your agency is in compliance and what, if any, additional actions your agency will need to take to become certified under OSC’s program.​​​

Is the No FEAR Act training sufficient to meet the supervisory training requirement?

In general, the No FEAR Act training will not be sufficient to meet the supervisory training requirement. The supervisory training should cover all 14 of the PPPs. With respect to PPPs, most No FEAR Act training programs only cover retaliation claims.  

## Outreach Training

Are government corporations subject to the Section 2302 requirements and required to complete certification?

​Under 5 U.S.C. § 2302(a)(c)(i), employees of government corporations are covered by the two retaliation prohibitions \[5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(8), (b)(9)\], while most other federal employees are covered by all 14 prohibited personnel practices. Therefore, government corporations are required to certify, but only with respect to the retaliation prohibitions.

## Outreach Training

Once I register for the program, how will I know that my agency is in compliance with OSC’s Certification Program?

If you have registered for the program, after completing the five requirements, you will be asked to submit a certificate of compliance form and documentation. After OSC approves the submission, OSC will grant you a certificate of compliance. Additionally, we list certified agencies on OSC's website and report federal agencies' compliance with OSC's Certification Program annually to Congress.​​​​​​

## Outreach Training

How often will agencies need to be certified as being in compliance with OSC’s Certification Program?

Agencies need to complete a checklist (coming soon) each year and submit a compliance form every three years.​​

## Outreach Training

How often does an agency need to train supervisors on PPPs and the Whistleblower Protection Act/Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (WPA/WPEA)?

In consultation with OSC, agencies need to train supervisors every three years on PPPs and whistleblower disclosures and each year on how to respond to complaints alleging a violation of whistleblower protections.​  

## Outreach Training

How often do employees need to be notified of their rights and remedies under the WPA/WPEA?

Employees must be notified annually.​​  

## Outreach Training

Will this program generate frivolous complaints?

Our experience is that agency-wide education programs have not resulted in a substantial increase in the number of complaints filed by employees of that agency, and often, such training helps prevent PPPs from occurring.​

## Outreach Training

If an agency has employees that are not covered by all Title 5 provisions, will they need to certify under OSC’s program?

Some agencies have federal employees who are only covered by a limited number of Title 5 provisions. If any provisions of the WPA/WPEA cover these employees, the agency is responsible for informing the employees of their rights and responsibilities under the statute, and certifying under the relevant provisions of OSC’s program.​  

## Outreach Training

What is 2302(c) certification?

OSC's 2302(c) Certification Program allows federal agencies to meet the statutory obligation to inform their workforces about the rights and remedies available to them under the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA), the Whistleblower Protection and Enhancement Act (WPEA), and related civil service laws. 5 U.S.C. § 2302(c). It also allows agencies to meet the requirements of the second Open Government National Action Plan. Under the 2302(c) Certification Program, OSC will certify an agency's compliance if the agency meets the following five requirements:

1.  Placing informational posters at agency facilities;
2.  Providing information to ​​new employees about the WPA/WPEA (including the 13 PPPs) as part of the orientation process;
3.  Providing information to current employees on an annual basis about the WPA/WPEA;
4.  Training supervisors every three years on the WPA/WPEA; and
5.  Displaying a link to OSC's website on the agency's website or intranet.
