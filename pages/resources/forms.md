​\*​Privacy Act Routine Uses: The information collected by OSC is used for official purposes. Some disclosure of information from OSC files is needed to fulfill OSC's investigative, prosecutorial, disclosure review, and related responsibilities. OSC published descriptions of 25 routine uses for information in its files in the Federal Register (F.R.), at 82 F.R. 45076​ (September 27, 2017). The routine uses permit OSC to furnish information to individuals or state or federal offices for purposes of review, consultation, investigation, administrative action, litigation, or reporting functions; to Congress; or to the public or the media as required by law or as determined by the Special Counsel to be necessary or in the public interest, and appropriate. A copy of these routine uses is available from OSC upon request and is also available here, [https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-09-27/pdf/2017-20596.pdf](../../~assets/documents/2017-20596.pdf).​
