​​​​​​The U.S. Office of Special Counsel ​(OSC) is committed to the goals of transparency, participation and collaboration for the American population. This webpage provides easy access to the many ways in which OSC operates in an open, transparent way. The White House's 2009 [Open Government Directive](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-06.pdf) and the 2013 [second Open Government National Action Plan​](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/us_national_action_plan_6p.pdf) require each agency to develop an [Open Government Plan​](/Resources/OSC_Open-Govt-Plan_Nov2014.pdf) that states how the agency will incorporate the principles of transparency, participation and collaboration into its core mission objectives.

OSC's [Open Government Plan](/Resources/OSC_Open-Govt-Plan_Nov2014.pdf) can be found [here​](/Resources/OSC_Open-Govt-Plan_Nov2014.pdf) (pdf).

### Information and Data

The White House's 2009 [Open Government Directive](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-06.pdf) and the 2013 [second Open Government National Action Plan​](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/us_national_action_plan_6p.pdf) require each agency to develop an [Open Government Plan​](/Resources/OSC_Open-Govt-Plan_Nov2014.pdf) that states how the agency will incorporate the principles of transparency, participation and collaboration into its core mission objectives.  OSC's [Open Government Plan](/Resources/OSC_Open-Govt-Plan_Nov2014.pdf) can be found [here​](/Resources/OSC_Open-Govt-Plan_Nov2014.pdf) (pdf).

OSC posts [annual reports](reports.md#tabGroup02 "Annual Reports to Congress") ​on its website cont​​aining a wide variety of useful information that date back to 1979. Examples of information that OSC makes public include:

- [OSC’s Annual Reports, Congressional Budget Justifications, Annual Performance and Accountability Reports, Federal Register Notices, and other information​​​](resources.md)
-  [Public Disclosures Files](publicfiles.md "Public Disclosures Files")
- OSC’s Organizational Chart​

​OSC also offers [training](services/pages/outreach.md) to federal agencies and non-federal organizat​ions in the various areas within OSC’s jurisdiction. Specifically, OSC offers training on (1) [prohibited personnel practices](services/pages/ppp.md), including reprisal for whistleblowing; (2) [whistleblower disclosures](services/pages/du.md) filed with OSC’s Disclosure Unit; (3) the [Hatch Act](services/pages/hatchact.md) and its application both to federal employees and to state and local employees; and (4) the [Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA)​](services/pages/userra.md). For information on how to request an OSC speaker please see [here​](services/pages/outreach-requestspeaker.md). Additionally, OSC publishes a variety of materials on prohibited personnel practices, whistleblower disclosures and the Hatch Act.

### Records Management Program​

The Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. 31) and other statutes require all federal agencies to create records that document their activities, file records for safe storage, efficient retrieval, and dispose of records according to Agency schedules.  OSC’s records program allows for federal records to be preserved, records located when needed, and destroyed according to its retention period.  Records management consists of three lifecycle stages: creation or receipt of a record or document; maintenance and use of records; and archiving and disposing of records.      ​

#### Policy and Guidance

[OMB M-19-21](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/M-19-21.pdf) requires all federal agencies to transition to electronic record keeping for all its records, both permanent and temporary records.

### Controlled Unclassified Information Program​

Executive Order (EO) 13556, [Controlled Unclassified Information](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2010/11/04/executive-order-13556-controlled-unclassified-information), establishes an open and uniform program for managing information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant to and consistent with law, regulations, and Government-wide policies that is classified under EO 13526.  The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has issued government-wide implementing regulations for executive branch agencies to implement the CUI program.​​

OSC’s CUI Program is a new program that intends to standardize the way we handle unclassified information that, although unclassified, is still sensitive and merits special controls to prevent unauthorized access. We designate, mark, safeguard, and disseminate unclassified information that laws, regulations, or government-wide policies require or allow agencies to protect using safeguarding or dissemination controls.​
