- question: I am a HUD resident. Can I file a PPP complaint at OSC?
  answer: |
    No. OSC does not have jurisdiction over complaints from residents of the Department of Housing and Urban Development regarding their housing situations in HUD facilities. OSC also lacks jurisdiction over complaints of fraud with respect to HUD benefits. If you have such a complaint, we recommend you contact HUD's Office of Inspector General at 1-800-347-3735.

- question: I work for the Postal Service. Can I file a PPP complaint at OSC?
  answer: |
    Maybe. OSC has limited jurisdiction over complaints from U.S. Postal Service employees. OSC can only review complaints from postal service employees that allege unlawful nepotism that allege unlawful nepotism or arbitrary and capricious withholding under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(7); 5 U.S.C. § 1216; 39 U.S.C. § 410(b) . If you believe that a Postal Service employee has hired, advanced, or advocated for the employment of a relative, you can file a complaint at OSC. All other complaints should be directed elsewhere.

- question: I am a government contractor or employee of a government contractor. Can I file a PPP complaint at OSC?
  answer: |
    No. OSC's jurisdiction is limited to complaints from federal employees. OSC does not have jurisdiction over government contractors or employees of government contractors. This is true even for contractors who work directly for federal agencies. Employees of contractors can bring a whistleblower retaliation complaint with the Office of Inspector General at the agency for whom the employee performed work under a government contract. Employee of contractors may also be eligible to file qui tam actions under the False Claims Act. More information about the False Claims Act is available [here](../../..//~assets/documents/C-FRAUDS%C3%BCA_Primer.pdf).

- question: I am a uniformed officer of the military. Can I file a PPP complaint at OSC?
  answer: |
    No. OSC has no authority to investigate PPP allegations from members of the uniformed service or to petition the Merit Systems Protection Board for disciplinary actions involving military officials (members of the uniformed services), since they are not "employees" who are "appointed in the civil service." See 5 U.S.C. § 2105. As defined in 5 U.S.C. § 2101(3), "uniformed services" means the armed forces, the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service, and the commissioned corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

- question: I am a commissioned officer in the Public Health Service. Can I file a PPP complaint at OSC?
  answer: |
    No. Employees of the Public Health Service are considered members of the "uniformed services," as described in the question above. Therefore, although these positions include civilian employment, that civilian employment is predicated upon your uniformed service. However, employees of the Public Health Service can file whistleblower retaliation complaints with the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services.

    No. We can help you determine whether OSC is an appropriate venue to address the complaint you describe but cannot provide legal advice as to whether you have a meritorious complaint or whether you should pursue other potential avenues, such as filing a grievance or filing an appeal at the Merit Systems Protection Board. A recommendation to consider filing a PPP complaint with OSC should not be viewed as an endorsement of the merits of your complaint. If OSC is not an appropriate venue, we try our best to suggest other options.

- question: Do I need a lawyer to file a PPP complaint at OSC?
  answer: |
    No. Although you are free to hire an attorney if you wish, it is not necessary to have an attorney to file a PPP complaint. OSC's attorneys have experience dealing with a wide range of complaints and complainants, and make every effort to communicate with you in a way anyone can understand.

- question: Can I file a PPP complaint anonymously at OSC?
  answer: |
    Yes. Anonymous complaints are acceptable. However, because we cannot contact an anonymous complainant to obtain additional information, such cases pose substantial investigative challenges. If you want to file a PPP complaint anonymously, you are encouraged to provide a detailed description of the nature of your complaint, including, where possible, names and dates. Alternatively, you may want to review the consent options included on form OSC-11, which give complainants the option of selecting from among three levels of confidentiality. This choice may alleviate some of the concerns you have about providing your name in a PPP complaint against your federal agency.

- question: I have filed an EEO complaint and/or administrative grievance. Can I still file a PPP complaint at OSC?
  answer: |
    Maybe. In the majority of cases, you can file a PPP complaint even after you have filed an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) complaint and/or an administrative grievance about the same issues. If your EEO complaint or administrative grievance has reached a federal court, OSC may not be able to pursue your PPP complaint because we would be bound by the court's decision on certain issues.

- question: What is OSC's policy about PPP complaints of discrimination?
  answer: |
    OSC's treatment of the discrimination complaint will vary depending on the allegations.
    Race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age and disability. Discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability is a PPP. 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(1). However, it was not intended that OSC duplicate or bypass the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) process established in both federal agencies and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for redressing discrimination complaints. 5 C.F.R. § 1810.1. Therefore, OSC generally defers discrimination complaints on these bases to the EEO process. At its discretion, however, OSC may investigate discrimination complaints on these bases, particularly where allegations include discrimination as well as other PPPs.
    Political affiliation and marital status. Discrimination based on political affiliation or marital status is a PPP. 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(1). Because discrimination complaints on these bases are not within EEOC's jurisdiction, OSC examines such complaints.
    Sexual orientation and gender identity. Discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is a PPP. 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(10). As such, OSC examines such complaints. EEOC has stated that discrimination complaints on these bases also may be brought under the [EEO process](http://www.eeoc.gov/federal/directives/lgbt_complaint_processing.cfm).

- question: How long does it take for my PPP complaint to be resolved?
  answer: |
    OSC makes every effort to resolve PPP complaints expeditiously, but given the variables between cases and the substantial increase in filings in recent years, it is difficult to estimate the length of time
    required to resolve an issue. If a complaint is closed following a preliminary investigation, that process usually takes about 120 days. If a complaint is referred for further investigation, the process can take
    significantly longer.

Please provide your name and complaint number (if known), and our staff will be able to direct you to the examiner assigned to your complaint. Additionally, when you speak to your examiner, you can discuss alternate methods of communicating with them.
  tags:
    - ppp
- question: What documents should I provide to assist my complaints examiner?
  answer: |
    Each PPP complaint is different, so each involves different documents. However, there are some documents that will almost always be necessary when reviewing a complaint. If the federal agency has proposed or taken an action against you, whether disciplinary or performance-based, you should provide the proposal, the decision, and any response you provided to the agency. For example, if the agency has proposed your removal, give OSC a copy of that proposal and your response, if you submitted one. If the agency put you on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), provide a copy of your most recent performance appraisal as well as the letter you received from the agency putting you on the PIP. In assessing whether to submit a document to OSC, focus on materials that are directly relevant to the complaint. Submitting large volumes of documents that are not related to the complaint that OSC is examining can delay the investigation of a complaint.​​ You should always maintain the originals of all documents provided to OSC. Only send OSC copies of your supporting documentation, unless otherwise requested.

- question: May I submit recordings to help document my case?
  answer: |
    Generally OSC will not consider unsolicited audio or video recordings in assessing the merits of your complaint. If any recordings are submitted, OSC will retain them as part of the record and they will not be returned to you, so do not send an original or sole copy of any video or audio recording.
    Please note before sending any recording to OSC that most agencies have policies that prohibit recordings of conversations at work without the participants' consent. In addition, state laws often require the consent of all parties to a conversation. _See_ [state's recording laws](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://recordinglaw.com/united-states-recording-laws/&data=05%7c02%7c%7c5b8923a86c6f4259da3708dc138af246%7c39dcbe17c0694d7c8ad7efbbedb5fc55%7c0%7c0%7c638406734700862935%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7c3000%7c%7c%7c&sdata=fz5bniuHgna4oR%2BrkVVNX5jDfimOx8WZTZSjBCyTZhQ%3D&reserved=0).

- question: Does OSC publish PPP reports containing its investigative findings and analyses?
  answer: |
   Under the “routine use” provisions of the Privacy Act, OSC may decide to publish its findings and analysis in a PPP case, typically contained in a PPP report, when there is a “legitimate public interest” in publishing the report. Legitimate public interests may include situations where guidance from OSC would be helpful on a legal or factual issue in the case; where the case involves a novel or emerging area of the law or a high level of media and/or congressional interest; or where publication would be educational for the federal government workforce. In such circumstances, OSC would redact personally identifiable information from the PPP report, and advise the complainant and agency about OSC's intent to publish the report. Such publications are typically accompanied by a press release.​

- question: Does OSC seek discipline against employees who commit a PPP?
  answer: |
   OSC may seek disciplinary action against an employee who commits a PPP. OSC uses different statutory provisions when it seeks disciplinary action than the provisions it uses for corrective action. OSC considers a number of factors when making the decision to seek disciplinary action, and consistent with the applicable statutory provisions, OSC's decision to seek disciplinary action is within OSC's prosecutorial discretion. Additionally, in some instances, OSC may not be able to disclose to the individual who filed the complaint the disciplinary action taken against the employee who committed a PPP.

- question: What are prohibited personnel practices (PPPs)?
  answer: |
    Prohibited personnel practices, commonly called PPPs, are employment-related activities that are banned in the federal workforce because they violate the merit system through some form of employment discrimination; retaliation; improper hiring practices; or failure to adhere to laws, rules, and regulations that concern the merit system principles.​

    An employee is a person appointed in the civil service and engaged in the performance of a federal function. The full definition appears at 5 U.S.C. §2105. An applicant is a person who has applied for a position described above. A former employee is a person who formerly held a position described above.

- question: I have filed a union grievance and/or MSPB appeal. Can I still file a PPP complaint at OSC?
  answer: |
    Maybe. If you have already filed a union grievance or an appeal with the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), there is an additional restriction on your ability to file a PPP complaint. The​ law requires that you select only one of three options to address an “otherwise appealable action.” 5 U.S.C. § 7121(g). Otherwise appealable actions include: adverse actions (removals, suspensions that exceed 14 days, reductions in grade or pay, and furloughs for 30 days or less), performance-based removals or reductions in grade, denials of within-grade salary increases, reduction-in-force actions, and denials of
    restoration or reemployment rights. Thus, if you experienced one of these actions, you may choose only one route to pursue your PPP complaint: (1) a PPP complaint at OSC; (2) a MSPB appeal; or (3) a union grievance. You will be bound by the first option you choose and cannot change your mind if you are dissatisfied with the outcome of the first option chosen. Please note that, if you have
    filed an MSPB appeal, and your filing has not been, or is not likely to be, dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, OSC will not pursue your PPP complaint because we are bound by the MSPB's decisions. Similarly, if your union grievance or MSPB appeal has reached a federal court, OSC may not be able to pursue your PPP complaint because we would be bound by the court's decision on certain issues.​​

- question: My PPP case is before the MSPB. Can OSC intervene in my case?
  answer: |
    Yes, under certain circumstances. OSC has the authority to formally submit its views on PPP cases pending before the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) in one of two ways: intervention or an amicus curiae (friend of the court) brief.
    OSC may choose to intervene in matters it deems highly significant to the proper functioning of the merit system, including cases under the Whistleblower Protection Act. In certain types of cases, OSC must obtain the consent of the person who filed the appeal before intervening. Given our limited resources, OSC cannot intervene on most cases.
    An amicus curiae brief is a legal argument provided to a court by a person or group who is not a party to the case, but who could be affected by the legal questions it raises. OSC may submit amicus curiae briefs to comment on legal issues that affect our ability to investigate and prosecute prohibited personnel practices. Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. § 1201.34(e), the MSPB has discretion to accept or reject these submissions.
    If you would like OSC to consider a request to intervene or file an amicus curiae brief, send an email to [amicus@osc.gov](mailto:amicus@osc.gov). Please include:​
    1.  The case name and docket number, if they have been assigned;
    2.  Whether you are requesting intervention or an amicus curiae brief;
    3.  What, if any, action the MSPB has taken in the matter to date;
    4.  Whether any MSPB proceedings are scheduled and, if so, what they are about and when they will be held; and
    5.  Why you are seeking OSC's participation, including a description of any novel or important legal issue in the proceeding.

    Maybe. An _amicus curiae_ (friend of the court) brief is a legal argument provided to a court by a person or group who is not a party to the case, but who could be affected by the legal questions it raises. OSC may file amicus curiae briefs in federal court cases that contain novel or significant issues of law with respect to 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(8) (whistleblower retaliation) or 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(9) (retaliation for engaging in protected activities), but not in cases involving other PPPs. Please note that while OSC is permitted file amicus curiae briefs in federal court, we cannot assist private litigants in other ways.
    If you would like OSC to consider submitting an _amicus curiae_ brief in your pending federal court case, send an email to [amicus@osc.gov](mailto:amicus@osc.gov). Please include:

- question: My PPP case was wrongly decided by the MSPB or a federal court. Can OSC assist me?
  answer: |
   No. OSC cannot change a final ruling by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) or a federal court. If your PPP case is or can be appealed, OSC may submit an amicus curiae brief before the MSPB regarding any PPP case, or before a federal court regarding only a case's impact on the PPPs involving whistleblower retaliation law (see above). OSC cannot provide legal advice on whether to appeal your case, or whether your case may be appealed.​​

- question: What is the difference between filing a PPP complaint with OSC and making a whistleblower disclosure to OSC?
  answer: |
    OSC investigates and prosecutes PPP complaints involving 13 specific practices that have been made illegal in the federal workforce. 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b). In most cases, PPP complaints are filed to challenge a personnel action that directly affects an employee for a prohibited reason.
    OSC also serves as a safe conduit for the receipt and evaluation of whistleblower disclosures from federal employees, applicants, and former employees. 5 U.S.C. § 1213. This evaluation process is separate and distinct from processing PPP complaints of retaliation for whistleblowing activities.​

- question: Does OSC investigate every PPP complaint?
  answer: |
    Yes. OSC investigates every PPP complaint to the extent necessary to determine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a PPP has occurred, exists, or is to be taken. However, the depth of investigation varies from case to case. For example, we may be able to determine with minimal investigation that a complaint has not met the basic elements of a PPP. Alternatively, our preliminary investigation may reveal that a more thorough investigation is necessary.

- question: Does OSC tell the federal agency that I filed a PPP complaint?
  answer: |
    OSC makes every effort to protect the identity of people who file with us. OSC generally does not alert an agency whenever a complaint is filed against it, nor do we identify the source of a complaint. However, it may be impossible to maintain the anonymity of a complainant when further in​vestigation is required. The nature of the complaint may also identify you as its source.

- question: I filed a PPP complaint about discrimination at OSC. Can I still file a complaint with the EEO office at my federal agency?
  answer: |
    Yes. OSC generally does not examine discrimination complaints based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability (or handicapping condition). EEOC has stated that discrimination complaints based on sexual orientation or gender identity also may be brought under the EEO process. Therefore, if you are alleging discrimination on any of these bases, you can file a discrimination complaint under the EEO process and with OSC. Note that there are specific time limits for filing discrimination complaints in the [EEO process](http://www.eeoc.gov/federal/directives/lgbt_complaint_processing.cfm). 29 C.F.R. Part 114.

  answer: |
    Yes. In investigations of matters under civil service law, rule, or regulation, federal employees are required to provide to OSC any information, testimony, documents, and material unless disclosure is prohibited by law or regulation. Likewise, federal agencies are required to make employees available to testify, on official time, and to provide pertinent records to OSC. OSC may also obtain subpoenas for documents or the attendance and testimony of witnesses. During an investigation, OSC may require employees and others to testify under oath, sign written statements, or respond formally to written questions.​

- question: Can a witness or subject official have a legal representative?
  answer: |
    Yes. As a witness or a subject in an OSC investigation, you may choose to have an attorney present at the OSC investigative interview. Witnesses, because they are not the persons responsible for the actions at issue in the PPP complaint, generally do not need legal counsel to advise them when they respond to OSC's questions. If, however, you have been identified as a subject of the investigation, i.e., you may be responsible for the personnel actions at issue, under some circumstances you could be subject to disciplinary action, and you may wish to have legal counsel at the interview. Please note that you are responsible for arranging for your own legal counsel. OSC will not recommend, designate, or arrange for representation for any witness or subject official. We will permit a reasonable amount of time to arrange for representation.
  tags:
    - ppp
- question: Can the federal agency send a representative to observe my interview?
  answer: |
    No. OSC does not permit a federal agency to send a representative to attend OSC interviews, but agency counsel may represent agency employees in limited circumstances. Similarly, an agency cannot require an employee to choose an agency attorney as their personal legal representative. This policy does not prevent an employee from _choosing_ an agency attorney to serve as his or her legal counsel, nor does it require agency counsel to act as the employee's legal representative.​​​

- question: Is OSC my lawyer?
  answer: |
    No. While OSC seeks corrective and/or disciplinary actions in meritorious PPP complaints, we do not have an attorney-client relationship with the employees who file with our office. If you would like to have a legal representative during the OSC complaint process, you are welcome to retain your own attorney. However, it is not necessary to hire an attorney to file a complaint with our office. Most of the employees who come to OSC for help represent themselves. Note that communications with OSC are not protected by the attorney-client privilege.

- question: What remedies are available to address my PPP complaint?
  answer: |
    Many forms of relief are available. They include corrective action, e.g., job restoration, reversal of suspensions and other adverse actions, back pay, compensatory damages, and reasonable and foreseeable damages, including attorney's fees. An employee may also ask OSC to request a delay, or "s​tay," of an adverse personnel action from the Merit Systems Protection Board, pending an investigation. OSC will consider a stay request if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a PPP action was taken. Finally, OSC may seek training on PPPs and merit system principles for agency officials.

- question: What if my agency retaliates against me for participating in an OSC investigation?
  answer: |
    Retaliation for filing an OSC complaint or cooperating with an OSC investigation is a PPP. 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(9). If you believe your agency has taken a personnel action against you in reprisal for engaging in either of these protected activities, you may file your own PPP complaint with our office.

- question: OSC closed my PPP case alleging whistleblower retaliation. Can I appeal this decision?
  answer: |
    Yes. If you alleged whistleblower retaliation in your PPP complaint, you may seek corrective action in an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). Such an appeal is known as an "individual right of action" (IRA). By law, the employee or applicant must first seek corrective action from OSC before filing an IRA. The IRA may be filed:
    *   after OSC closes a matter in which retaliation for whistleblowing has been alleged; or
    *   120 days after a PPP complaint is filed with OSC, if OSC has not notified the complainant that it will seek corrective action.
    The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 expanded the IRA right to include most 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(9) retaliation claims, including:
    *   retaliation for filing a whistleblower appeal, complaint, or grievance;
    *   retaliation for assisting an individual in the exercise of an appeal, complaint, or grievance right;
    *   retaliation for cooperating with or disclosing information to the Inspector General of a federal agency, or the Special Counsel; or
    *   retaliation for refusing to obey an order that would require the individual to violate a law.
    Procedures for filing an IRA are set forth in MSPB regulations at [5 C.F.R. Part 1209](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/5/part-1209). Note that, if OSC closed your retaliation case, your IRA appeal must be filed within 65 days of the date of the OSC notice advising you that OSC is closing the case or within 60 days after the ​date you receive the OSC notice, whichever is later. In considering an IRA, the MSPB may refuse to accept any matters that were not specifically presented to OSC first. Similarly, the MSPB will only consider retaliation allegations in an IRA appeal.

- question: OSC closed my case and I did not allege retaliation for whistleblowing in my complaint. Can I appeal this decision?
  answer: |
    Yes, but only under some circumstances. The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 expanded the IRA right to include most reprisal claims under 2302(b)(9), which is reprisal for engaging in protected activity. If you alleged reprisal f​or engaging in any of the following activities under 2302(b)(9), you may file an IRA with the MSPB (if OSC closed your complaint or has not notified you within 120 days that it will seek corrective action your behalf):
    1.  retaliation for filing a whistleblower appeal, complaint, or grievance;
    2.  retaliation for assisting an individual in the exercise of an appeal, complaint, or grievance right;
    3.  retaliation for cooperating with or disclosing information to the Inspector General of an agency, or the Special Counsel; or
    4.  retaliation for refusing to obey an order that would require the individual to violate a law.
    If your complaint did not allege reprisal for whistleblowing under (b)(8) or reprisal for protected activity under (b)(9), the law does not allow you to file an IRA with the MSPB.

- question: Can the federal agency have its own representative in an OSC interview?
  answer: |
    No. OSC does not permit a federal agency to send a representative to attend OSC interviews, but agency counsel may represent agency employees in limited circumstances. Similarly, an agency cannot require an employee to choose an agency attorney as their personal legal representative. This policy does not prevent an employee from _choosing_ an agency attorney to serve as his or her legal counsel, nor does it require agency counsel to act as the employee's legal representative.​​​

- question: What is a federal agency's responsibility during an OSC investigation?
  answer: |
    Federal agencies must provide OSC w​ith timely access to all records and information that relate to OSC's investigation. See 5 U.S.C. § 1212(b)(5)(A). Agencies cannot use a claim of common law privilege, such as attorney-client privilege, to withhold records or information from OSC. See 5 U.S.C. § 1212(b)(5)(C)(i). By providing records and information to OSC, agencies will not be deemed to have waived the privilege against a non-federal entity or individual in any other proceeding. See 5 U.S.C. § 1212(b)(5)(C)(ii).
    Federal agencies are also required to make employees available to testify, on official time, and to preserve and provide pertinent records and information to OSC. See 5 C.F.R. § 5.4.
    Additionally, federal agencies are prohibited from retaliating against employees who file complaints with OSC or cooperate with an OSC investigation.​

- question: What information can OSC provide to the federal agency about pending PPP complaints?
  answer: |
    Very little. If a federal agency liaison has responded to our request for information in a particular case, OSC staff may state whether the PPP complaint is open or closed, but generally does not provide specific information about the matter, including our factual findings, the progress of our investigation, or the reasons for closing our file. In some cases, an agency may propose corrective action before OSC's investigation is finished. Before entering into settlement negotiations with an agency, OSC would obtain the consent of the complainant to pursue a potential resolution of the case.

- question: How is a disclosure to OSC different from disclosures through other government channels?
  answer: |
    *   Federal law guarantees your [confidentiality](/services/disclosure-of-wrongdoing/confidentiality);
    *   The Special Counsel may order the head of the agency involved to investigate and report on your disclosure; and
    *   The Special Counsel may send the agency's report, and your comments, to the President and Congress.
  tags:

- question: What happens when you make a disclosure?
  answer: |
    OSC does not independently investigate whistleblower disclosures. If the Special Counsel finds that the information you disclosed is, or is substantially likely to be, the type of wrongdoing described [here](/services/disclosure-of-wrongdoing/process), OSC will send the information to the head of the agency concerned. OSC will not divulge your identity unless you consent.
    The agency head must conduct an investigation and submit a report to the OSC. The Special Counsel then sends the agency report, together with your comments and hers, if any, to the President and the appropriate congressional oversight committees.
  tags:
    - dow
- question: What happens if the Special Counsel finds that the information you disclosed is not, or is not substantially likely to be, the type of wrongdoing that it can refer to an agency?
  answer: |
    If the Special Counsel does not send your information to the agency head, OSC sends you a letter explaining why the Special Counsel did not refer the information. This letter will let you know what other disclosure channels may be available to you.
    At their discretion, the Special Counsel may decide to send the information to the agency head, even if he or she does not find that it is, or is substantially likely to be, the type of wrongdoing described [here](/services/disclosure-of-wrongdoing/overview). If he or she does, the agency head is required to inform the Special Counsel in writing of what action has been or is being taken and when such action shall be completed. The Special Counsel will then inform you of the agency's report.

- question: How long does it take?
  answer: You will usually hear from an OSC staff member within two weeks of filing your disclosure. The OSC staff member will explain the process and timing to you then.

- question: Are all employees, former employees, or applicants for employment in the federal government able to file a disclosure?
  answer: |
    No. OSC does not have jurisdiction over disclosures filed by:
    *   Employees of the U.S. Postal Service and the Postal Regulatory Commission;
    *   Members of the armed forces of the United States (i.e., non-civilian military employees);
    *   State employees operating under federal grants;
    *   Other employees or federal agencies exempt by federal law; and
    *   Congressional or judicial branch employees
    
    Certain disclosures that involve foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information must be transmitted immediately by the Special Counsel to the National Security Advisor and congressional intelligence committees.

- question: If I am going away on military duty, do I need to give copies of my orders to my employer?
  answer: |
    While it is best practice to provide copies of your military orders to your employer **prior** to performing your military duty (if possible), you are not required to do so. You are simply required to provide advance verbal or written notice that the absence is due to military service. However, upon your return, if your military service was for more than 30 days (or if you requested paid military leave for some or all of that service), your employer may request copies of your orders, but cannot delay your reemployment pending receipt of those orders.
  tags:
    - userra
- question: When I return from military duty, do I have to report back to work right away?
  answer: |
    In order to obtain reemployment protections under USERRA when you return from military duty, you must report for work or request reemployment within a specific time period. Depending on the length of your military duty as follows:
    *   If you were on military duty for less than 30 days, you must report to work on the next regularly scheduled business day or shift that you normally work after time for safe travel plus eight hours' rest.
    *   For example, if an individual works a night shift and their military duty ends at 5:00pm on Monday January 1st, and their next regularly scheduled shift is a night shift at 8:00pm Monday January 1st, that individual would not have to report for that shift, but the next one (8:00pm on Tuesday, January 2nd).
    *   If you were on military duty for 31 to 180 days, you have to request reemployment within 14 days of the end of your military duty.
    *   If you were on military duty for more than 180 days, you have to request reemployment within 90 days of the end of your military duty.
    
    If an individual does not report within the proper time frame, she may be reemployed, but is subject to discipline by her employer for being absent without leave (AWOL) for the amount of time she exceeded the reporting period.

- question: How should my employer have me listed in their payroll system while I am on military duty?
  answer: |
    Employers should place service members in a leave without pay (LWOP) status while they are on military duty, unless the employee has paid leave that they wish to use for any of that time. Ideally, the LWOP entry should indicate that the employee is out for military service, as distinct from other types of LWOP such as a leave of absence or furlough; many employers designate this type of leave as LWOP-US or LWOP-MIL. Employees should **not** be placed on absent without leave status (AWOL), even pending submission of a copy of their orders.

- question: Why should I consider using OSC's mediation program?
  answer: |
    OSC offers voluntary mediation in selected Prohibited Personnel Practice (PPP) cases between federal employee complainants and agencies.  There are several reasons why OSC's mediation program may be beneficial to both employees and agencies:
    *   **_Confidentiality_** _-_ Mediation provides employees and agencies with an opportunity to explore and negotiate resolution of the employee's OSC complaint in a confidential setting.
    *   **_Retain Control Over Outcome_** _-_ Employees and agencies are the sole decision-makers who determine if they will mediate and whether and how they will resolve the OSC complaint.
    *   **_Experienced OSC Mediators_** _-_ Mediators are OSC attorneys who are trained in both mediation and PPP law, enabling them to understand the issues and to assist parties with brainstorming meaningful, creative, and innovative solutions.
    *   **_Informal and Flexible Process_** _-_ Mediators collaborate with participants to ensure that the process is tailored to their specific needs.
    *   **_Creative and Innovative Solutions_** _-_ Employees and agencies can customize resolution options to meet their specific needs, interests, and objectives.
    *   **_No Cost for Mediation Services_** _-_ There is no charge for OSC mediation services.

- question: Where are mediation sessions held?
  answer: Participants can choose to mediate online via Zoom for Government (FedRAMP) or Microsoft Teams (FedRAMP), or in-person at OSC's office in Washington, DC, or another convenient location, if travel funds permit.
  tags:
    - adr
- question: Who participates in the mediation session?
  answer: |
    In addition to OSC mediators, the employee, their attorney (if applicable), and the agency's attorney and settlement official attend the mediation session.  OSC requires the agency settlement official (an agency management official with authority necessary to resolve the dispute) to attend the entire mediation session.  Any individuals who would be investigated by OSC as subjects of the complaint may not serve as the agency settlement official.
  tags:
    - adr
- question: What should I expect if I choose OSC mediation?
  answer: |
    If OSC offers mediation, and both the employee and agency agree to participate in mediation, all mediation participants will be asked to sign an Agreement to Mediate, and the pre-mediation process will begin.  During the pre-mediation process, mediators engage in confidential discussions with each party to better understand their perspectives and interests; facilitate information sharing; brainstorm potential options for resolution; and convey initial offers and counteroffers.  Participants are expected to engage actively in the pre-mediation process.  Cases may settle prior to the mediation session as the employee and agency share resolution options.
    The initial mediation session is generally scheduled for 2-3 months after the employee and agency agree to mediation.  Throughout the process, mediation remains voluntary; anyone may withdraw at any time.
  tags:
    - adr
- question: How often do cases settle in mediation, and what happens if the case does not settle?
  answer: |
    At OSC, more than two-thirds of completed mediations result in settlement.  If the employee and agency reach a mutually-agreeable resolution, they will then write and sign a settlement agreement.  If the employee and agency do not reach a settlement, the case will be transferred back to the OSC investigative attorney.  Anything discussed during the mediation process remains confidential.

- question: Is the program voluntary?
  answer: |
    The requirement to inform agency employees of the rights and remedies available to them under the PPP and whistleblower provisions of Title 5 is a statutory obligation. 5 U.S.C. § 2302(d)​. In late 2017, the President signed two pieces of legislation requiring the head of each agency, in consultation with OSC, and the Inspector General of the agency, to take steps such as providing annual training to supervisors. These steps may be satistfied under OSC's Certification Program.

- question: What is 2302(c) certification?
  answer: |
    OSC's 2302(c) Certification Program allows federal agencies to meet the statutory obligation to inform their workforces about the rights and remedies available to them under the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA), the Whistleblower Protection and Enhancement Act (WPEA), and related civil service laws. 5 U.S.C. § 2302(c). It also allows agencies to meet the requirements of the second Open Government National Action Plan. Under the 2302(c) Certification Program, OSC will certify an agency's compliance if the agency meets the following five requirements:
    1.  Placing informational posters at agency facilities;
    2.  Providing information to new employees about the WPA/WPEA (including the 13 PPPs) as part of the orientation process;
    3.  Providing information to current employees on an annual basis about the WPA/WPEA;
    4.  Training supervisors every three years on the WPA/WPEA; and
